  <p>Building upon the foundational work begun in <a href="/courses//crwr-1240-writing-for-new-forms-and-media/">Writing for New Forms and Media</a>, a course in which we explore the turbulence and opportunity of the digital landscape, Creativity on the Web helps learners further develop their digital literacy, creativity, and design skills. Learners will focus on the integrated tasks of writing, design, promotion, and publishing. They will learn how to create an engaging online presence for their creative work and will explore approaches to developing a creative identity on the Web. They will develop their skills through individual designs and compositions, group work, and the creation of digital portfolios.</p>

  <p>We use a rhizomatic approach in this course (and in all IDEA courses). In rhizomatic learning, the community is the curriculum. <a href="http://davecormier.com">Dave Cormier</a>, one of the leaders in rhizomatic learning in Canada, describes the process as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    In the rhizomatic model of learning, curriculum is not driven by predefined inputs from experts; it is constructed and negotiated in real time by the contributions of those engaged in the learning process. This community acts as the curriculum, spontaneously shaping, constructing, and reconstructing itself and the subject of its learning... learners come from different contexts, they need different things, and presuming you know what those things are is like believing in magic... Organizing a conversation, a course, a meeting or anything else to be rhizomatic involves creating a context, maybe some boundaries, within which a conversation can grow...
  </blockquote>

  <p>In rhizomatic learning — which draws upon research into complex adaptive systems theory, cognitive science, anthropology, and hermeneutics — “the knowledge lives in the community. You engage with it by probing into the community, sensing the response and then adjusting... It is a learning approach that is full of uncertainty, not least for the educator. But it’s one that allows for the development of the literacies that will allow us to sharpen our ability to participate in complex decision making. Dealing with the uncertainty is what the learning is all about.”</p>

  <p>The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creativity is an interactive process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.</p>

  <h3>In the classroom</h3>

  <p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Repeat: we are not creating such a group. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.</p>

  <h3>Skill Development</h3>

  <p>Learners will explore the following themes:</p>

  <ul class="unstyled">

    <li>Tracking social media accounts and histories</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will also discussion promotion, publishing, and the overal meta-skill of portfolio development. In turn, these interconnected themes lead to the following topics and considerations:</p>

  <ul class="unstyled">
    <li>Writing well on the Web</li>

    <li>Filter bubbles and contexts</li>

    <li>Content curation and development</li>

    <li>Device and browser responsiviness</li>

    <li>Progressive enhancement</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assignments</h3>

  <p>Three creative projects are required for this course: a digital portfolio, an online community project, and a digital composition project. These projects are opportunities for you to discover and explore your digital creativity. We will discuss these projects in class.</p>

  <p>Each of the three projects is worth 25 per cent each of your final grade.</p>

  <h3>Group Presentations</h3>

  <p>Each student will also be a member of several different peer groups; each peer group will present on various topics. Every class session will involve presentations. Class time will be given for preparing the presentations. The structure and content of the presentations will be discussed in class.</p>

  <p>The group presentations are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.</p>

  <h3>Evaluation of Assignments and Presentations</h3>

  <p>My primary focus, as an instructor, is to assist you in developing your creativity. Grades are quite far down on the list of priorities for me. I am focused on your engagement with the process, your commitment to your own work, the extent to which you show up, metaphorically, to be as present as you can be. These are evaluation criteria for me.</p>

  <h3>Assessment</h3>

  <p>The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Developing a sense of personal, academic, and professional direction is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with abilities and practical techniques. Therefore, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.</p>

  <p>You will be expected to participate actively and to complete all course assignments. While attendance is voluntary (as it is in most post-secondary courses), the key to success in any course involves taking time to integrate material from lectures, discussions, activities, and your own reflections. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to catch up. Please ask your instructor if you are unsure about how to do this.</p>

  <p>The following (not exhaustive) list of considerations will be used in determining the quality of your attendance and participation:</p>

  <h4>Assessment Criteria</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Demonstration of commitment to self-development.</li>

    <li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>

    <li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.</li>

    <li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>

    <li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>

    <li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone.</li>

    <li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>

    <li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately.</li>

    <li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>

    <li>Willingness to speak up and to contribute.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Assessment Philosophy</h4>

  <p>Effective participation in this class has multiple dimensions, some of which may be measured objectively (such as effective writing) and some of which are signals of interpersonal ability and self-awareness. Interpersonal abilities are subtle, difficult to quantify, complex beyond any measurement scheme, and are the single most important predictor of life success. Accordingly, we pay great attention to interpersonal ability in this class, and we offer the following guidelines for assessing your own development in this area:</p>

  <p>Those who possess exemplary personal abilities are relaxed, open, responsive, and kind. Often they exhibit abilities that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. To some extent, these features – which are aspects of temperament more than they are learned skills – can be evaluated using rating scales based on observation. Empathy rating scales are often used for this purpose in counselling training programs. Such scales, or other, similar assessment measures, are useful as baselines, or starting points; but they cannot replace the interpretations of peers and colleagues – of regular people, in other words – in assessing the quality of interpersonal ability. There are simply far too many factors in interpersonal communication for any standardized evaluation procedure to measure.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, many details of interpersonal ability are well-known, and may be summarized as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Commitment to the development of self-awareness.</li>

    <li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>

    <li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.</li>

    <li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>

    <li>Commitment to enhancing interpersonal experience.</li>

    <li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgements.</li>

    <li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>

    <li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately.</li>

    <li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please pay attention to these qualities and abilities as we move forward.</p>
