Questions re.CRWR 2140: Writing and Creativity on the Web              

Question #1: 
Comment: In the Learning Objectives/Outcomes, there is no clear indication of a comparative/critical approach to the question of how writers/artists currently establish and/or actively subvert the production of their “online presence.” 

We are interested in helping students find voice and place on the Web. Our goals focus on awareness, confidence, creativity, and community. This course is not intended to explore questions such as "how writers/artists... actively subvert the production of their online presence." On the other hand, there is "no clear indication" that we ignore such questions, or that we encounter any of the themes of the curriculum in anything other than a scholarly and critical manner.

In Creative Writing, we do not exert our biases in course outlines. We do not determine what students should think or believe. Rather, our course outlines help students explore the landscape of their intended careers.

Fine Arts course example!

Much of the proposal deals with notions of “promotion,” “selling,” “leveraging,” and “designing for emotion.” Is there a plan to complicate or introduce comparative approaches to what “design” on the Internet entails, or is this course primarily teaching students soft marketing skills?

Students need now -- more than ever -- to explore issues such as marketing and promotion (which is one reason why Kwantlen offers degrees in Marketing). Students need the ability to be reflective and purposeful about these themes, and to come to their own conclusions (beyond the biases of instructors or of the University) about how they wish to proceed in a professional world awash in marketing, promotion, and leveraged design.

In Creative Writing, we do not treat marketing and promotion as inherently good or bad, professional or academic, useful or corrosive. It's not that simple. We help students understand how to understand these themes. We use "comparative approaches" as well as many other modalities in exploring these themes.

Kwantlen's mission and mandate indicates that our programs of study "provide applied learning and broad-based university education." Additionally, the mission document indicates that "we support multiple approaches to research and innovation to address community, industry, and market needs. We encourage faculty and learners to participate in many forms of knowledge generation and research, including those focused on discovery, creativity, application, and teaching."

Discovery, creativity, and application are essential aspects of this course.


Question #2: What specifically does this course offer students that other similar courses already available at Kwantlen do not? 

This course is for writers.

Many courses at Kwantlen offer similar content viewed through a distinctive lens (the Fine Arts department, for example, offers curriculum for film studies that is equivalent to essentially identical curriculum in the Creative Writing department).

We welcome collaboration and integration, and would be happy to explore how curriculum from various departments might be integrated or co-created. But, at the moment, there is no history of such collobration nor any practical means of doing it.

Besides, there is no requirement that a given course at Kwantlen must be entirely distinct from any other course.

Question #3: 
Comment: The course, as presented, covers a significant and diverse range of material.

Course outlines should provide sufficient information that a visiting instructor would be able to create the proper learning environment, learning experiences, and learning materials for a course section by consulting the course outline only. All Creative Writing courses are developed in this manner.


How can a 12-week course meaningfully instruct students in web design, writing skills for the Internet, writing for promotion, publishing, and portfolio 
development? 

We don't cover all of these themes in exhaustive detail (each one could be a degree in itself). We cover them all in some detail, with the general aim of offering students a means of developing their digital literacy and promoting their digital creativity (with writing, but with design as well).

Our experience has been somewhat ironic: the more details one includes in a course outline, the more questions people ask and exceptions people make. Given this situation, we could create very brief outlines: some outlines from other departments have Content sections of one paragraph. However, we prefer the inclusion of details in outlines -- to help our cohort of instructors navigate the teaching process. ...

Fine Arts example?

Additionally, this course explores four themes through the lens of writing...


Question #4: 
What does “a gentle introduction to code” mean?  

Students will learn how to read HTML5, CSS, and some Javascript. They will learn to identify and understand the code behind compliant and responsive design. They will not learn to debug stack traces.

We believe that language which promotes optimism and encourages student confidence (language such as the word "gentle") is useful in guiding a curriculum that includes material (coding) that students often find very challenging.


Question #5:  The title of the course is “Writing and Creativity on the Web.” Might this instead be “Writing and Creativity on the Internet”? 
Comment: The “web” is merely a system of interlinked hypertext documents while the “Internet” is a broader global system of interconnected computer networks that includes interfaces like IM, chat, FTP, email etc...  presumably aspects that a course like this is likely to address.

The Wikipedia definition of the Internet as "a global system of interconnected computer networks" (quoted without attribution in the question above) is accurate in basic terms; but, more technically, the Internet is the set of communications protocols (TCP and IP, among others) that form a network of many protocols and layers. One of those protocols (IP) now includes everything from televisions to cars to (some) light bulbs, so any definition of the Internet as a field of inquiry is fraught with difficulty.

This course focuses on one protocol --  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP, commonly known as the Web) -- and the experience layer. We do not explore (in this course) Instant Messaging, chat, File Transfer Protocol, email, and the like. We focus on the Web, which is specific to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) documents and applications.

Because the course focuses on the Web, the course title reflects this.

Question #6: 
Why is a book introducing HTML5, a hypertext markup language (which remains in an experimental phase of development) is on the syllabus? It seems well-beyond the understanding of beginner students outside computer science.

HTML5 is not in an experimental phase. Since May 2011, HTML5 has been advanced to "Last Call" status as a Working Draft. The target date for Recommendation status is 2014. Moreover, much new web development is now done in HTML5 (http://www.alistapart.com/topics/code/html5/), and many high-traffic sites are built with HTML5 (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Bing, Pandora, The Financial Times, Typekit, and so on).

HTML5 is the current standard for new web development. In our view, all discussions of web development should include HTML5 as the foundation.

Basic literacy in HTML5 will not be "well-beyond the understanding" of students of CRWR 2140, who will already have been exposed to HTML5 in the prerequsite for this course, CRWR 1240.

Writers today need to have the basic ability to read HTML5, to alter/adapt code as necessary, and to create valid, semantically-correct, standards-compliant, responsive websites. CRWR 2140 will help them develop this skill.

(The W3C validator reports 248 validation, semantics, and compliance errors and 81 warnings for the website of the faculty member who asked these questions.)


Question #7:
Please say more about the selection of learning resources in relation to course learning objectives and the placement of the course at the second year level.
Comment: The learning resources selected for this course do not seem to reflect a scholarly or rigorous approach to the subject matter.

The word "rigor" is used frequently at Kwantlen in discussions about curriculum. The argument is often made that rigor (and, by extension, scholarship) is a matter of what books students read, or what content instructors provide in the classroom. Our view is that rigor is not primarily a matter of content delivery but rather student engagement. In other words, rigor is what students do, not what instructors or textbooks say.

Rigor, excellence, and standards have little to do with the amount of content described in a course outline. In our view, rigor and excellence consist of:

* How much purposeful and relevant work students undertake in a given course.

* How much depth, commitment and engagement students demonstrate in the context of their learning.

* How much interpersonal interaction students encourage in the context of the their mentorship by the instructor.

Kwantlen's Mission and Mandate document indicates that "we provide and promote a learning environment in which learners examine and develop their values, goals, and character through the integration of personal, academic, and professional inquiry." This is the essence of rigor, and it is about what happens in the classroom, not on the page.

Furthermore, standards of rigor and excellence have not been defined at Kwantlen. The Course Outline Manual contains no information about rigor, no discussion of rigor, and no criteria for excellence or rigor.

Policy L11 contains no information about rigor, no discussion of rigor, and no criteria for rigor. Policy L11 does mention "standards of excellence," which are not defined nor discussed in that policy (or in any policy).

Kwantlen's Mission calls for an approach that is real-world, applicable, community-focused, and broad-based, "to prepare our learners for a complex world." Accordingly, students in CRWR 2140 -- who are preparing for careers in the world of new publishing -- need to be reading what web publishers and web developers are reading. And they need to be participating in the kinds of creative communities that flourish (through crowdsourcing) on the Web.

At the moment, web development firms and new publishers hire very few university graduates. They prefer applicants who have real-world experience with web design and development. These firms and publishers often note that the digital knoweldge of university graduates (their literacy with HTML5, for example, or their knowledge of online collaboration tools) is several years out-of-date. Conversely, self-trained, entrepreneurial applicants who have spent less time in libraries and more time in communities on the Web are much better prepared fo careers in new and social media. (Jason Fried Big Think interview; personal conversation with Philip Till of CKNW).

This is one of the reasons why the course outline for CRWR 2140 does not focus much on library resources or books; we don't use them much. Instead, we use emerging technologies and practices, such as digital collaboraties, social media, and crowdsoursing. These are the tools and practices of the Web and of new publishers. If our students seek to work in the field of digital creativity (as they most surely do), they need to learn these skills as fundamental aspects of their degrees.

"The statement that the library has sufficient resources in this area" is correct for the purposes of this course. We simply do not use the library (instead, we build our readings online, as almost all new publishers and new media professionals do).

"The Anderson text is a popular business book that mostly discusses the online market place as a potential for niche markets..."

Knowledge of niche markets, the long tail, and Extremistan economic environments is essential for any writer moving into the world of digital publishing. Anderson's books are unquestionably the most influential texts in this area, and students should know about them. 

"...an uncritical and less than scholarly approach..."

Leaving aside (for the moment) the tone of this statement -- dismissive, superior, disdainful -- the statement itself is problematic. A course outline does not (and cannot, under the current Kwantlen course development system) reflect the ways in which critical approaches and scholarship are integrated into the learning environments of classrooms. Critical thinking and critical approaches are practices and activities that students do; they are not  determined by book titles or descriptions in a course outline. Critical thinking is a practice, a methodology. Its role in a given course is not determined by the outline but rather in how the instructor engages students. The claim of an "uncritical" approach cannot be made legitimately by viewing this outline (or any other course outline at Kwantlen).

The phrase "less than scholarly [sic]" continues the dismissive tone, which does not help to promote Kwantlen's much-needed collegiality, professionalism, and organizational development (but, perhaps the aim here is to subvert rather than support these principles).

Furthermore, the questioner is not (in our view) in a strong position to criticize the scholarly approach of Creative Writing when she herself uses the less-than-scholarly Wikipedia as the basis of her argument in a previous question.

Also: it's unfortunate that this is the level of discourse.

Kwantlen's Mission articulates the role of our scholarship in preparing "our learners for a complex world. We value scholarship as a socially relevant obligation and opportunity. We support multiple approaches to research and innovation to address community, industry, and market needs. Community engagement is the manner in which we demonstrate our commitment to the social value of the University."

Creative Writing 2140 focuses on relevant curriculum (socially and professionally), community and industry needs, and market conditions. The course emphasizes engagement in the real world of the Web. We read what Web developers and new publishers read; we use what they use; we do what they do. We also question, and think critically, and approach these studies with a blend of scepticism and curiosity. And we look forward to a Kwantlen in which real-world learning -- which, after all, is the basis of our charter -- is not subject to disparagement and instinctive opposition.

"A cursory look at this field’s rich scholarly research reveals many possibilities for a far more university-appropriate level of critical engagement."
