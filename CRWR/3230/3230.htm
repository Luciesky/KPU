<p>Welcome to Creative Writing 3230, a course in the creativity and craft of non-fiction writing. This course is designed to offer you the opportunity to explore your writing in a focused and collaborative environment, to assist you in honing the quality of your work, and to invite you to participate in the joys (and challenges) of the art of writing.</p>

<h2>The Basic Philosophy of the Course</h2>

<p>Creative writing is a powerful, ancient, and yet delicate practice. We write -- quietly, often in isolation, in tentative and mercurial moods. (Quick craft tip: an em-dash is often more effective than a colon when used before a short list, as in the sentence above.) We revise, and turn back upon our own narratives, and wonder about the reception our work might meet in the world. Sometimes we hide manuscripts in drawers, or take deliberate action -- as did Franz Kafka and Mahatma Gandhi -- to prevent our words from making their way to an audience. Kafka and Gandhi were both unsuccessful in preventing their writings from being destroyed; but their impulse to do so, to keep hooded the hawk of their creativity, is common among writers of all stripes. We're not sure that we have, really, anything to say; or we are afraid that if our words are not well met we might ourselves be wounded. Or we believe, as did the ancient Egyptians, that words have their own life, for good or for ill, and that writing is a means of seizing the power of the gods. This course attempts to explore this conversation -- between the writer and the wider world -- and to find ways of bringing our writing safely out of hiding.</p>

<p>We will be exploring craft, and method, and the strategic practices every writer must learn in wrestling with narrative. Each of us will examine our strengths -- the ways in which the natural mood and flavour of our writing makes itself known -- and our vulnerabilities as well: how we get stuck, or lazy, how we lost confidence and gain doubt. How we learn to shut down and hope the whole thing will go away. (Quick craft tip: a sentence does not always require a traditional subject-verb structure. Sometimes, as in the sentence above, setting off a dependent clause as its own sentence is an effective method of punctuating the thought.)</p>

<p>This course is about writing, and reading, and making a claim for our fundamental right to use words on paper. Within that context, we will explore the ethics of writing (particularly about one's own family or culture of history), the hurdles of writing (as they involve craft and precision and clarity) and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that is to say, the long tradition of writers of creative non-fiction).</p>

<p>The threshold between fact and fiction (which is not the same as that between truth and lie) is the territory of creative non-fiction. In this course we stake out that territory, inspecting the geology of its forms and ideals, finding our own individual places to homestead. Creative non-fiction involves the search for truth, and fidelity to fact, yet also an awareness that truth and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do about it.

And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the foundation of all the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>Art, craft, power, purpose: writing is all these things, and many others too. In this course we will make connections between the various threads of creative writing, forge those connections in our own work, and share that work with one another. (Quick craft tip: "each other" is best used when two people or items are involved; "one another" is best used when there are more than two.)</p>

<h3>Suggested Activity:</h3>
Before you do much more in this course, go to your local video store and rent (and watch) two excellent creative writing films:
<em>Wonder Boys</em> and <em>Finding Forrester</em>. In these films I hope you will see both the persistence and delicacy of the craft of writing, the ways in which creativity might be stalled or jump-started, the strange turns that make the art of writing so compelling.

<h2>Approaches and Practices</h2>

<p>This course involves three basic activities: reading, writing, and sharing. (Quick craft tip: it has become common practice to omit the final comma in a list, but this is not a rule. One method of determining what will work best is to read the sentence aloud. If the comma serves the spoken rhythm of the sentence, leave it in; if not, take it out.)</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>The reader for this course may be purchased from the bookstore. The main text of the reader is also available online <a href="www.rosslaird.info/crwr3230/">here</a>. In addition to the reader, please read at least one of the books on the creative non-fiction <a href="http://www.rosslaird.info/crwr3230/booklist">book list</a> (some of these books are also excerpted in the reader).

One method of approaching the literature for this course is to read for craft and for pleasure. Look for the strategies and methods of the various authors we'll be reading: how they construct narratives, how they use tricks and tools, how they carry the reader along with a skill that seems effortless. These are artifacts of craft. And, in addition to these, </p>
