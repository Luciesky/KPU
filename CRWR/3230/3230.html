<p>Several  writing assignments are required for this course. You may view them in the descriptions for the various weeks in which they are assigned. Most of the assignments are relatively brief in terms of length (as, for example, choosing some of your favorite words). These smaller assignments are intended to provoke your creativity and your thought, to encourage you to start thinking in terms of writing as a craft as opposed to simply a means of ejecting your thoughts onto paper. (This last comment is a jibe against a mode of writing much in vogue today: spontaneous writing, in which we are encouraged to write without thought, splashing words onto the page, in haste, in full emotional flight, saving editing and precision for a later, more sober frame on mind. As we will discuss in the class, I am not a fan of this style of composition. Among other liabilities, it wastes a great deal of effort and time.)</p>

<p>The smaller assignments build toward a final project: a non-fiction composition on a chosen subject and of chosen length. I have not prescribed a particular length for this project for a philosophical reason: a great essay can be a few pages long (as we'll see). Yet it is difficult to craft a non-fiction essay in less than about three thousand words; so, if you prefer a guideline for the length of the final project, I offer two recommendations: make it as long as it needs to be; make it somewhere between three and five thousand words. There is no upper limit on the length of the final project.

Sharing

<p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are <em>not</em> going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Repeat: we are not creating such a group. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgement. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.</p>
