Summary:

In Tibetan Buddhism, Chenrizi is considered to be the embodiment of compassion. In his various forms, he is the most revered bodhisattva in Buddhism (a boddisattva is one who achieves enlightenment but chooses to remain in this world until all other sentient beings achieve enlightenment). The manifestation of Chenrizi is specific to Tibetan Buddhism, which spread to Tibet from India around the fifth century CE.

Chenrizi's role in Tibetan Buddhism is to guide and protect the Tibetan people. The vehicle by which this is accomplished is the reincarnation of Chenrizi in the person of the Dalai Lama. Accordingly, the current Dalai Lama (Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th successive Dalai Lami) is considered to be a manifestation of Chenrizi. The Dalai Lama also is considered to be a regular person as well as a reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama. Therefore he possesses three incarnate parts: Chenrizi, the previous Dalai Lama, and Tenzin Gyatso.
