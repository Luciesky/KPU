Hi Diane;

As promised, I'm following up with my reflections about yesterday's HSCC meeting. As you will see from my comments below, the issues have now become larger and more complex.

As you know, I was invited to the HSCC meeting to answer questions about the course outline for CRWR 1240. You and I had also discussed the importance of making sure that appropriate steps had been taken to contain or curtail the kinds of actionable comments that were made (about me) at the previous HSCC meeting. So, naturally, I attended yesterday's meeting with some expectation that my concerns would be addressed and that my responses to the questions would be heard. However, that is not what happened.

There was no discussion about process, or purview, nor any reinforcement of colegial behavior. There was not mention of any need for adjustments of process or procedure, no discusion of the norms and guidelines of the committee, and no 

no containmne of actionable items

My presence at the meeting, and the purpose for my presence, were not acknowledged, and I was not asked to present my answers to the documented questions. I had to intervene with a specific request to present, which was granted.

Even so, I had no real opportunity to present my answers to the questions. After about 90 seconds I was interrupted with a questin about whether I would delivering a monologue,  then I was repeatedly interrupted about every ten seconds after that. These interruptions consistently diverted the conversation away from my responses and toward other matters chosen by Fine Arts faculty (mostly involving the Creative Writing department's alleged lack of rigor).

I did not get through my response to a single question

actionable

For what it's worth, Shelly did try to dampen some of the inappropriate contributions (by asking people to stay focused on the outline and not other matters), but her efforts made no difference. The actionable comments continued.


damaging students
implies they have spoken to students and therefore spread the cantagion.

endorsement of such behavior
word "art"

Beyond just me: Creative Writing

What next?

The course was passed, though there was no discussion about the criteria for voting (there are only two criteria: departmental plans and departmental standards), so the votes against (of whih there were three: two from the Fine Arts faculty and one from an educational advisor) were undertaken for reasons other than the consistency of the course outline with departmental plans and standards.
