\section{Course Overview}

The contemporary age is one of tremendous upheaval and uncertainty for the literary arts. New technologies challenge established business practices. Nascent and rapidly emerging markets pose new questions about processes and products. Conflicted conversations about rights and the uses of creative commodity dominate an increasingly fractured landscape. Within this turbulent tumble lies the writer as artist: pressured by the exigencies of commerce, burdened by the minutiae of intellectual property law, increasingly hobbled by anxiety and disorientation.

The writer now feels at the whim of indifferent and unpredictable forces. The buffers which once protected professional writers from the messiness and incipient momentum of the market are now, for the most part, dismantled or disintegrating. Creative and professional paths that once were secure are now fraught with new obstacles. The sacred space of creative inquiry seems under threat. The artifacts of that inquiry have lost much of their meaning. The casual blog has vanquished the thoughtful book.

At least, this is how it seems to many writers working today: dark times, enemies at the gate.
But this is how all the great stories begin. Turbulence -- emotional, cultural, political -- is the source and fuel of creativity. The current age is thus a great gift. Artists and writers are now free, in the philosophical (and perhaps spiritual) sense, free to pursue the clamour and craft of their work, in a manner that we have not encountered before. Not since the audacious invention of writing itself.
Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA) 1240 invites writers to discover -- or rediscover -- the unrivaled adventure of creative work in the world today. The path forward is not labyrinthine but requires, rather -- like most daunting tasks -- that a small number of simplicities reveal themselves behind the swirl of turbulence. Course participants will learn about various technologies of creativity -- this, of course, is a pertinent and pressing matter -- but the course workshop is not, primarily, another introduction to blogging, social networking, web content, and viral marketing. These are only the outer appearance -- the carapace, the shell -- of what amounts to a re-imagining of what it means to be a creative person in the world today.

Creative Writing 1240 is a course about reclaiming the fundamental right of creative endeavour and choosing the paths that lead forward.

Freedom, adventure, opportunity: these are the watchwords of the contemporary creative professional. Every age calls its inhabitants to action. How do we know this? Writers tell us. How do they tell us? By facing their own crises of confidence, by wrestling with the emerging norms and practices of their time, by seizing the word as their instrument and their stand. Why should we expect our age to be any different? Why would we want it to be?

\section{Learning Goals}

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}

\item Define new forms and media of creative writing.
\item Use the Internet and the World Wide Web in the context of new forms and media for creative writing.
\item Use computer applications to develop creative writing compositions.
\item Use computer applications to manage document histories and versions.
\item Describe the features and functions of online creative writing tools.
\item Describe and use online tools of new and social media.
\item Use online collaboration tools.
\item Create documents online.
\item Edit documents online.
\item Share documents online.
\item Describe the purpose and functions of online communities.
\item Contribute to online communities.
\item Facilitate online discussions and projects.

\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Experiences}
The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creative inquiry is an interactive process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.

We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts and education: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Repeat: we are not creating such a group. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our work together, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our contributions. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.

\section{Demonstration of Learning}

\subsection{Creative Compositions}

This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a minimum of 5 compositions of at least 600 words each. You may write more, if you like. There is no maximum. These compositions will be included in your digital portfolio (see below). The compositions can be in any genre and on any topic you choose. The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your literary passion. The compositions will be discussed in detail in class.

Please see the Resources section at the end of this outline for suggestions about composition.

The compositions will conclude with a self-assessment of at least 500 words (which may be included in the digital portfolio or may be submitted separately). The self-assessment will include answers to the following questions (answers need not be itemized): 

 \begin{itemize}
\item What research did you do to prepare for your writing? Research might include readings, investigative interviews, online searches, self-reflections, ruminations, and many other modalities. 

\item What learning resources did you use? These might include books, articles, online resources, and so on.

\item Of the research and readings you undertook, what impressed you as being most interesting or relevant?

\item What kinds of experiments did you undertake with your writing? How did you spend your time, and how did it go? (Look at the criteria on the next page.)

\item What went well, where did you struggle, and how do you feel about the process you undertook?

\item What were the best and worst moments of your writing? What did you learn from these moments?

\item Are you proud of your writing for this course? Is it your best work? What grade would you give yourself?

\item How might you improve your writing?

\item What did you learn about yourself while working on the compositions for this course?

\item How does what you learned apply to your studies at Kwantlen and to your sense of your future direction?

\item Do you plan to continue these compositions further, or to work on similar projects in the future?

\item You learned something crucial in these compositions which you won't discover for a while. Make a guess now about what that might be.

\end{itemize}

The compositions are collectively worth 25 percent of your grade.

\subsubsection{Assessment Criteria for the Creative Compositions}

Projects for this course are focused on authentic and creative inquiry. Accordingly, the following criteria -- which are based on the philosophy of creative inquiry  --  are used to evaluate engagement and commitment to the individual project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
\item Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes discomfort.
\item Openness to personal and interpersonal process.
\item Willingness to collaborate with others.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.
\item Willingness to approach academic inquiry as a skill with discrete steps and standards.
\item Commitment to improvement in writing and creative work.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the above criteria, compositional criteria are also used to evaluate your writing, as follows (in percentages):

\begin{description}

\item[$80-100$] Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and
  vigorous. The writing invites reading; the work is well-crafted and
  grammatically flawless. The author is perceptive.

\item[$76-79$] Very good: the use of language is generally correct.
  There may be a need for further editing. This could be in the
  presentation of the work (style, voice, characterisation, plot,
  point of view), or in the language (diction, grammar, usage,
  spelling, punctuation)~--- but the writing is involving.

\item[$72-75$] Good: the author has created a manuscript with
  substantial content and without any serious errors in tone or
  narration. Problems with creative shaping and delivery may occur,
  and there may be a further need for learning the mechanics of
  language use, but generally, the problems do not interfere with the
  reader's appreciation of the work.

\item[$68-71$] Manuscripts with repeated errors in grammar, usage or
  punctuation will result in a grade of no higher than 71 regardless
  of the proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative
  aspects of the work. On the other hand, manuscripts with no problems
  in grammar, usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than
  71 if they fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges
  (of style or voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre.


\item[$64-67$] Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language
  (either in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in
  repeated errors in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the
  treatment of the material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The
  writing is potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the
  manuscript.

\item[$60-63$] This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment
  without in any way exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as
  spelling mistakes, sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing.

\item[$56-59$] Below average: the writing is difficult to read because
  of inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or both.
  Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This
  grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which
  the graded course was a pre-requisite.

\item[$50-55$] Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of
  creative writing or has not tried.

\end{description}


\subsection{Group Project}

Each student will be a member of several different peer groups; each peer group will present at least one mini-presentation (roughly thirty minutes) on a topic of choice. Each class session after the second will involve presentations, with one presentation from each group. Class time will be given for preparing the presentations. The structure and content of the presentations will be discussed in class.

\subsubsection{Presentation Methods and Goals}

The central idea of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities to practice creative thinking and expression.  As such, the presentation should be creative. Essentially, this means that you should try to use multiple presentation strategies and modalities. These might include (but are certainly not limited to) any of the following:

 \begin{itemize}
 \item Storytelling
 \item Poetry
 \item Music (playing)
 \item Drumming
 \item Singing
 \item Dance
 \item Movement
 \item Sport
 \item Ritual
 \item Film (showing)
 \item Film making
 \item Photography
 \item Web content
 \item Craft work
 \item Art making
 \item Individual reflection
 \item Meditation
 \item Health practices
 \item Creative process (any type)
 \item Group communication
 \item Cultural practices
 \item Nature experiences
 \end{itemize}

 Whenever possible (and workable), try to mix together multiple modalities into a single presentation. For example, you might ask the group to do some individual reflection using the modality of poetry,
 then create a series of movements based on the poetry, then work in small groups to talk about and share the process. Many configurations are possible. The trick is to choose an activity that you enjoy, then find a way to apply it to the content (suggested presentation topics are listed below). Please do not create your presentations using only written and/or spoken materials. In other words, don't just stand up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic. Utilize the energy of the group. Remember that in interdisciplinary work divergences are valued as unique opportunities. So, feel free to experiment with activities and modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand but which might, upon experiment, yield surprising connections and results. Be playful.
 Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage with the process in novel and interesting ways.

The presentations should (ideally) not be complete explanations or presentations of material. Feel free to play with challenging exercises, with impossible scenarios, and other conundra. One way to think about this is to consider insoluble riddles, such as the one in \textit{Alice in Wonderland}: Why is a raven like a
writing desk?

\begin{quote}
  ``Have you guessed the riddle yet?'' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\\
``No, I give it up,'' Alice replied. ``What's the answer?''\\
``I haven't the slightest idea,'' said the Hatter.\\
``Nor I,'' said the March Hare.\\
Alice sighed wearily. ``I think you might do something better with the time,'' she said, ``than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.''
\end{quote}

The best interdisciplinary topics offer more questions than answers. They, are essentially, gateways into the mysterious--which, as Einstein will tell you, is an important place to be:

\begin{quote}
  The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is
  the source of all true art and science.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Suggested Topics for Presentations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tim Berners-Lee and the beginnings of the Web
\item Online privacy and identity
\item The cloud and what it means
\item The filter bubble
\item Why code is (or can be) beautiful)
\item Why word processors are evil
\item Hacking and cracking
\item The true meaning of Geek
\item SOPA, Copyright, and the future of creativity
\item Why digital text is better than printed text
\item Content management systems (and which one to choose)
\item The meanings of Open, Free, Closed, and Proprietary
\item Free (as in beer) and free (as in speech)
\item Digital security (or, how to prevent your email from being hacked)
\item The W3C

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assessment Criteria for Group Presentations and Overall Engagement}

This course utilizes experiential learning approaches, which depend upon student involvement and active participation. Accordingly, the following criteria are used to evaluate overall participation and engagement in the group presentations and the class:

\begin{itemize}
\item Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
\item Willingness to speak up and to lead.
\item Openness to interpersonal process.
\item Willingness to collaborate with others.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
\item Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
 
\end{itemize}

The group presentations and overall course engagement are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.

\subsection{Online Community Project}

We will create an online component of the course for us to share ideas, resources, and conversations. Your contribution to this online community will represent your online community project, and will include weekly contributions (at least one comment or contribution per week). The assessment criteria for this project are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extent and appropriateness of online contributions
\item Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
\item Willingness to lead and contribute positively to online conversations.
\item Openness to interpersonal process in the online sphere.
\item Willingness to collaborate with others online.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others online.
\item Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the online group.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments in the context of online conversation.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility for learning and learning technologies.
\item Willingness to deal with online conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
\item Ability to give and receive appropriate online feedback.
 
\end{itemize}

The online community project is worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.

\subsection{Digital Portfolio}

This course explores a wide range of digital modalities, disciplines, and approaches. By the end of the semester you will have accumulated a wealth of material: not only from your own compositions but also from your group work, your online contributions, and your classroom experiences. This collected material is your portfolio, and it should become a foundational piece of your academic work this semester. The portfolio project involves the synthesis of this material into a digital portfolio that you can carry forward (and build upon) as your studies evolve. The digital portfolio can be developed within a hosted content management system (such as Posterous or WordPress) or on a website you develop yourself (if you know how to do that). We will discuss the digital portfolio at length in class.

The portfolio will include a self-assessment of at least 500 words. The self-assessment (which can be part of the portfolio itself or submitted separately) will include answers to the following questions (answers need not be itemized):

 \begin{itemize}

\item Of the research and readings you undertook this semester, what impressed you as being most interesting or relevant?

\item What went well, where did you struggle, and how do you feel about the process you undertook during this course?

\item What were the best and worst moments of this semester? What did you learn from these moments?

\item Are you proud of your work this semester? Is it your best work? If not, why not?

\item What grade would you give yourself, and why?

\item How might you have improved your experience this semester?

\item What did you learn about yourself while working in this course?

\item What will you remember about this course in five years?

\item How does what you learned apply to your studies at Kwantlen and to your sense of your future direction?

\item What advice would you give to others who might be undertaking a similar path?

\item What's next for you?

\item You learned something crucial in this course which you won't discover for a while. Make a guess now about what that might be.

\end{itemize}

The portfolio is worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.

\subsection{Attendance and Participation}
The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of authentic and interdisciplinary inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

Creative inquiry is a unique process. Unlike many other fields, in which competence and skill may be measured objectively, using replicable and consistent means (tests of factual knowledge, for example), authentic creative inquiry depends greatly on the interpersonal skills of the practitioner. Computer programmers can be assessed by their ability to write code; chiropractors can be evaluated based on their skill at manipulating the human skeleton; race car drivers can be clocked around a track. But for interdisciplinary scholars there are no such fixed measures. The interpersonal skills of authentic creative inquiry are subtle, difficult to quantify, and complex beyond any measurement scheme.

And yet we can identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, kind (Jacob Bronowski is probably the best modern example). Often they exhibit skills that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:

\begin{itemize}
\item Commitment to the development of self-awareness.
\item Openness to interpersonal process.
\item Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
\item Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
\end{itemize}

Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:

\begin{itemize}
\item What am I feeling right now?
\item What am I thinking right now?
\item Why am I reacting in this particular way?
\item What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
\item Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
\item Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
\item When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
\item In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?
 
\end{itemize}

These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you. At the very least, you might wish to consider what you are currently working on in your life, in which direction your attention is drawn, into which of the innumerable themes of human nature you are now called to delve.

In my role as your instructor, I will be paying attention to how thoughtful you are in examining and responding to questions like those in the lists above. I will not be analyzing you, but rather noticing what kinds of things you do, what your reactions are to various situations. My goal in observing your behaviors and interacting with you is to assist you in developing greater self-awareness (and, by extension, greater creativity).

I will use the lists above, as well as the assessment criteria listed for each assignment, to assess your overall participation in the course. I will not be evaluating your level of self-awareness but rather your openness to the process of developing your self-awareness.

\subsection{Grade Inflation}
Almost every semester there are students who do well on the assignments, complete all the associated learning goals of the course, participate well, and wonder why they do not receive a grade of one hundred percent (or 98, anyway). Here is the reason: almost every semester there are students who demonstrates a level of commitment that goes beyond the course requirement. Such students complete extra work, or hand in exemplary assignments, or undertake a significant amount of personal development in addition to the course expectations. Such students typically receive the highest grades.

If you do reasonably well in the course you will receive a reasonable grade. Very high grades are intended for extra or exemplary work. Unfortunately, over the past thirty years the post-secondary educational system in North America has participated in a process of grade inflation. Since the 1980's, the average grade for typical course work has been increasing by about 25 per cent each decade.
Elevated assessments do not accurately reflect the work of most students. Even worse, grade inflation has caused many students to expect high grades for average work. I am not a overly stringent assessor; but I will not inflate grades artificially.

In this course a small number of students will (likely) receive high grades; most students will receive grades in the middle range; and a few students will struggle with lower grades. If you are uncertain about your assessment for a given assignment, or if you wish to know where, roughly, you are along the distribution curve of the class, or if you would like suggestions for how to improve your grade, please ask me for clarification.

If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Show up for class -- every class. This course depends on student engagement. (This becomes especially important during the final weeks of the semester.)
\item Contribute consistently to the online community and respond to the contributions of others.
\item Be attentive and mindful to the various criteria listed for each of the projects and the course overall.
\item Take the initiative to plan and develop your projects and presentations. This course is (very likely) more fluid and spontaneous than you are used to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is crucial.
\item Speak up in every class (review the criteria for group engagement and presentations).
\item Don't look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead, find the answer that is meaningful to you.
\item Ask for help if you need it.
\item Commit to your projects in a substantial way. Good projects take time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{How to Start Writing}

Stop whatever else you are doing. Close your email application and Facebook, turn off the background music, silence your cell phone. Put it all away. Do it now. I'll wait.

Sit in silence, without distraction, and read this post. Silence the part of you that makes false claims about the utility of background music or the necessity of leaving your cell phone turned on. Silence the part of you that wants to argue with me, right now, about my unreasonableness, the part of you that makes claims for this or that distraction. Still the monkey mind that never shuts up, never stops talking, never ceases inventing new ways to jostle, cajole, argue. Stop arguing and listen: the voice of a writer can only be found within silence.

Silence.

Start with that. Stay within it. Allow it to grow around you, to blossom, to disclose the images and words that inhabit the landscape of your inner life. Don't control it, or direct the flow of that nascent energy. Sit, and read, and watch yourself.

Forget that you are trying to write. This fact is irrelevant to the creative process. It is a curiosity. A writer finds and follows the creative voice. The means by which this happens, the structure in which it unfolds, the particulars of the path: these are secondary and inconsequential. A writer follows the path, whenever it appears and wherever it leads.

A writer does not invent or create the writing. Instead, the act of authentic writing leads the writer. Accordingly, the task of the writer is to find -- within -- the stream, thread, and path of creative energy. Writing inhabits its own life, is its own animal, is a being struggling to be free of the cages we build around it. Don't take my word for it. Find the cage, find the animal.

Listen.

Stop arguing. Your arguments, like mine, only serve to strengthen the cage. The animal of the creative is not swayed by our smartness, our wit, our experiences. It does not care how many books we have read or how many fancy words we know. It is not interested in our expertise and the many ways in which we layer our insecurities one over the other.

The animal of the creative wanders the landscape of gods and heroes. The animal has seen things we no longer remember. The animal is what we once were but have chosen to cage as a means of protecting ourselves from the vastness of what we cannot grasp, the depths into which we no longer dare to gaze.

The creative animal is primordial, eternal, wise beyond our knowing. It has been waiting for us, all this time. Listen to what it has to say.

Write.

Allow the creative animal to write for you one good word, or sentence, or paragraph. Don't mess up the writing. It is difficult to say what this means, this messing up. Perhaps you are cool, or smart, or erudite. Forget all that crap. It is meaningless. Write honestly. Let the creative animal speak through you.

If, as you write, you start to worry about what people might think of your writing, you may as well not start. Give it up now, before you waste any more time. Or tell the part of you that wants to be a rabbit rather than a wolf to shut the hell up.

Write something. Don't worry about what genre it is. Genres have no meaning. Writing — all writing — is, at heart, an extended negotiation with the creative animal. That animal is partly you, yes; but is also not you, is wholly an emissary of that mystery we run from and slide toward.

And the animal is — for the most part — silent. Do not forget this. Words are not the creative, cannot be the creative, will never be the creative. They are echoes. Treat them as such. Find the source of those echoes.

Find the cage. Find the animal.

\subsection{Steps to Better Writing}

For most of its history literature has taken the form of epic poetry. This history is long: five thousand years, perhaps much longer. And within the genre of epic poetry -- from the Egyptian Pyramid Texts to Homer to the Kalevala -- every word counts. The rhythm counts. The resonance and fluidity count. No slack exists in these texts, no lazy meanderings of phrase or structure. These ancients texts are spare, clean, and tight. We could learn a great deal from these archaic authors. There are reasons for the enduring quality of their texts.


So, to be an epic poet:
\begin{itemize}
\item Write one sentence at a time.
\item Review the sentence before moving on. Make it as perfect as you can. Spend all day on one sentence if required (but don't spend too long...)
\item Make sure your sentence contains the best words for what you are trying to say.
\item Examine the phrase order. Look for a tighter order, more spare or visceral or elegant.
\item Speak the sentence aloud. Find its rhythm and sonority. Tweak as required. Don't rush.
\item Take out all extra words and lazy phrasings, especially those that are habitual. Excise adverbs, gerunds, and verb phrases (``there is...'', ``I've done...'', ``We're going...'') whenever possible.
\item Shorten the sentence if you can (without diminishing its meaning).
\item Take a short break, gaze out the window, return to the sentence, and review it once more.
\item Leave it alone. Build your next sentence.
\end{itemize}

Good writing builds sentence upon sentence. Each new contribution adds to the structure and the framework of clarity. Why go farther (Quick Tip: "farther" refers to distance or extent; "further" denotes an action in service of) -- why go farther down your creative track when the foundation is not yet established? I know, you have probably been told to just write, to get words on the page, to come back to them later and try to make sense of your scratchings. No, I am not a fan of this approach. I prefer to approach writing as a Zen-like activity, an action of the razor-sharp mind and open heart working together. Writing, for me, is not catharsis but clarity.

Let's take a practical example. Here's a possible sentence:

\vspace{1em}

\textsf{Down on Granville Street, where my grandfather's jewelry store used \\
to be, there are now a bunch of old, boarded-up buildings waiting quietly \\
to be renovated.}
\vspace{1em}

Alright, this is a start. I'm trying to say something in this sentence: about change, nostalgia, perhaps about renewal. It's not yet clear. So, let's start with the beginning:

\vspace{1em}
\textsf{Down on Granville Street}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{Down} and \textsf{on} are both prepositions, only one of which is required. Therefore we can make this first phrase more succinct:

\vspace{1em}
\textsf{On Granville Street}
\vspace{1em}

Next up, the second phrase:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{where my grandfather's jewelry store used to be}
\vspace{1em}

This phrase is the heart of the sentence; it needs to be clear and strong. \textsf{Used to be} is an awkward verb phrase. It tries to articulate, in three words, the nostalgia and ambivalence of the sentence. And yet, \textsf{used to be} is almost devoid of meaning here. It is a marker and nothing more. Let's try something more robust and imaginal:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{where my grandfather's jewelry store once stood}
\vspace{1em}

By using \textsf{once stood} in this way, we're indicating the past in more resonant terms. We are also implying a fall -- what once stood, then fell. Also, we're implying a steadfastness of the old place, a sense of presence that was previously lacking. So far so good. Now, onto the tricky part:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{there are now a bunch of old, boarded-up buildings \\
waiting quietly to be renovated}
\vspace{1em}

Well, this is a tidy mess. Too many things going on, too many overt indications when subtlety is called for. Not to mention the awkward phrase \textsf{a bunch of}. Yikes. Where to begin? How about with some editing:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{...old, boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated}
\vspace{1em}

OK, this makes things a bit easier. Now we have the rudiments of a decent clause, something about old buildings:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated}
\vspace{1em}

We know that the gerunds and adverbs are typically (except right here!) to be avoided, so we can clean up the phrase:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{boarded-up buildings wait} to be renovated
\vspace{1em}

Now, \textsf{tumbledown} is a better word than \textsf{boarded-up} (\textsf{ramshackle} would be good here, too). And \textsf{wait to be renovated} is awkward and anthropomorphic in a way that doesn't seem to suit the imagery of the sentence. And we might spruce up the language a bit with some alliteration (use sparingly!):
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{tumbledown buildings lie in lethargy}
\vspace{1em}

Better. But I keep thinking about \textsf{ramshackle} and \textsf{tumbledown}. Could I use both? Let's see:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{ramshackle buildings lie in lethargy upon the tumbledown street.}
\vspace{1em}

I like this. But it will require that I abandon my theme of renewal. The sentence will be more sad without it, yet probably more authentic too. And less self-conscious. Let's try the whole thing out:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{On Granville Street, where my grandfather's jewelry store once stood, \\
ramshackle buildings lie in lethargy upon the tumbledown street.}
\vspace{1em}

Not bad. The sentence embodies nostalgia, sadness, personal and social loss, and something else -- but we don't know what yet. It's something about what happens next, or later, the contrast between the past and the present. The sentence itself leads me on, as its writer, to the next stage. It provokes me to think about contrasts, about words such as \textsf{glittering} and \textsf{forlorn}, and about what we preserve and discard. I cannot write the next sentence without first the polished catalyst of the first.

\subsection{Practical Tips}

\begin{description}
\item [Use Concrete Imagery] The writer is a ruminative animal (like a cow, in fact). We chew over our lives and histories, we digest and express the stories to which we are drawn. This process requires a good deal of thought. Writers think -- cogitate speculate, perambulate -- and we write down our thoughts. Yet we forget, often, that the reader does not have access to our mind, does not perceive the interconnections and contexts which lead us to our conclusions. We must show the reader that context, the web of threads and images by which we derive our narratives. And this requires that we replace our inner ruminations with concrete imagery.

On its own, unaccompanied by imagery, \textsf{I am sad} is poor writing. The reader is offered no means by which to understand the cause or nature of the sadness. The writer must provide the path to understanding by way of imagery. Typically, the rule for this situation involves four or five concrete images for each internal rumination. Like so:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{
Sheets of rain strike the window. I gaze into the dark, searching for  the glimmer of proud trees across the field. Too dark to see anything. The house, empty now, twists and groans in the sidelong wind. Every whisper of its movement reminds me of the long, sad night ahead.
}
\vspace{1em}

In the above passage, sad is embedded within imagery, layered, integrated. It is not a rumination but a concrete indication of feeling. And it comes in the last of five sentences, thus proving the rule. This rule also has another name: \textit{Show, Don't Tell}.

\item [Use the present tense] Even when writing about the past, the present tense is usually the best route to clarity. Other tenses and moods require more words, encourage abstraction, and introduce a barrier between the immediacy of the reader and the distance of the text. These problems are most evident when writers use the subjunctive mood (or tense), which is defined as follows:

\textit{Subjunctive: a mood that represent an act or state (not as a fact but) as contingent or possible.
}

Strictly speaking, the subjunctive mood uses words such as \textsf{if, that, though, lest, unless, except, until} and so on. But in a more general way, the subjunctive mood, or tense, might be described as any writing that removes the reader from the concrete and present tense:
\vspace{1em}


\textsf{I wish my dog were here.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{If Dave were stronger, he would have been able to lift the tree stump.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{If I had paid more attention to my instructor's tips about creative writing, I would be a better writer.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{I requested that John be present at the wedding.}
\vspace{1em}


The above examples illustrate various ways in which subjunctive approaches to writing introduce extra words and awkward phrases. Replacing these with concrete phrases in the present tense improves the writing:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{My dog is here.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{Dave is not strong enough the lift the stump.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{I listen to my creative writing instructor. My writing improves.}
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{John comes to the wedding.}
\vspace{1em}

Here is a short list of words and phrases that often accompany writing that meanders away from the present tense and from concrete imagery. Avoid these words and phrases whenever possible:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{there, would, could, were/was, has/had, even, those/these, that/this}
\vspace{1em}

\item [Avoid adverbs and gerunds] A gerund is a noun formed from a verb: walking, for example. Gerunds usually end in \textsf{ing}, and their erasure is one of the single most positive changes a writer can make. Gerunds are problematic for two reasons: they encourage adverbs and they drift toward abstraction (see tips one and two).

For example, a writer may describe a scene of walking as follows:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{I was walking down the street, quickly, not paying too much attention to the hurtling traffic and the shop-keepers shouting stridently from their stalls.}
\vspace{1em}

This vignette is neither in the present tense (and is therefore less concrete than it might be) nor is it crisp and clear enough. As soon as the writer begins with the gerund walking, all the other adverbs and gerunds in the sentence follow naturally; awkwardly and naturally. Gerunds, therefore, imply adverbs and abstraction. Also, gerunds require more words and tenses: \textsf{was walking} requires two words to state a simple verb. Here's how to reduce the confusion:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{I walk down the street. My steps are quick, my attention wanders. I do not notice the hurtling traffic, nor the shouts of strident shop-keepers as I pass their stalls.}
\vspace{1em}

The revised passage is more immediate, possesses an air of expectation (of suspense, almost), is constructed with precision, and contains no extra words. The revision begins with a present tense action: I walk down the street. The remainder of the passage builds naturally, preserves the original clarity. Better. Stronger.

Like gerunds, adverbs -- typically words that end in \textsf{ly} --  introduce abstraction and encourage awkward phrasings. An adverb qualifies a verb, limits or augments the verbal meaning. As such, an adverb serves the same function as a bank of fog laid across a shoreline. The fog obscures, mediates, filters. Almost always, adverbs may be replaced with more accurate verbs and fewer words; as in the example above, with the adverb quickly replaced by the verb quick and a concrete image of the steps of the walker.

Gerunds and adverbs are not always avoidable. They are necessary at times, and need not be shunned entirely. But often they are lazy solutions. Avoid them whenever feasible.


\item [Tune your vocabulary] Writing is not speech. And yet the habits of speech tend to infiltrate writing. Resist this whenever possible: look for these infiltrations, replace them with narrative structures, preserve the clarity of your vision. For example, \textsf{I am not a farmer, and I do not eat broccoli} is better than \textsf{I'm not a farmer, and I don't eat broccoli}. Apostrophes derive from speech, and are usually to be avoided in writing (except in the case of possessives, obviously). In similar fashion, it is best to limit the use, in writing, of the following common and conversational words:
\vspace{1em}

\textsf{really, very, it, quite, real, some, somehow, someone, something, everything, thing, anyone, maybe,little, been, your, never, always, only, just, deep, people, about, being, get, guess
}
\vspace{1em}

The vocabulary of a writer need not be coruscating or arcane or hermetic. Small and common words will do, and in most cases should do. Small words encourage precision and clarity. The order of such words, the manner in which they are structured as narrative and not as speech, determines much of the quality of writing.

\item [Know your habits] In addition to the various strategies outlined above, writers also need to be aware of their individual proclivities: their habits of laziness, their favorite and over-used words, the ways in which they sacrifice clarity for muddiness. The following are the most common secondary errors:

\begin{itemize}\item Awkward phrase order in compound sentences
\item Awkward shifts of scene or tense
\item Awkward use of vocabulary
\item Lack of clear narrative direction
\item Stating the obvious rather than showing through imagery
\end{itemize}

These habits and their kin -- the many pitfalls and hurdles that lie along the path of writing -- are avoided only through practice. Go slow, review each sentence as you write, make a list of your common errors and search for each error as you compose. Remember the primary goal: clarity.
