<p>The contemporary age is one of tremendous upheaval and uncertainty for the literary arts. New technologies challenge established business practices. Nascent and rapidly emerging markets pose new questions about processes and products. Conflicted conversations about rights and the uses of creative commodity dominate an increasingly fractured landscape. Within this turbulent tumble lies the writer as artist: pressured by the exigencies of commerce, burdened by the minutiae of intellectual property law, increasingly hobbled by anxiety and disorientation.</p>
<p>The writer now feels at the whim of indifferent and unpredictable forces. The buffers which once protected professional writers from the messiness and incipient momentum of the market are now, for the most part, dismantled or disintegrating. Creative and professional paths that once were secure are now fraught with new obstacles. The sacred space of creative inquiry seems under threat. The artifacts of that inquiry have lost much of their meaning. The casual blog has vanquished the thoughtful book.</p>
<p>At least, this is how it seems to many writers working today: dark times, enemies at the gate. But this is how all the great stories begin. Turbulence &ndash; emotional, cultural, political &ndash; is the source and fuel of creativity. The current age is thus a great gift. Artists and writers are now free, in the philosophical (and perhaps spiritual) sense, free to pursue the clamour and craft of their work, in a manner that we have not encountered before. Not since the audacious invention of writing itself. Creative Writing 1240 invites writers to discover &ndash; or rediscover &ndash; the unrivaled adventure of creative work in the world today. The path forward is not labyrinthine but requires, rather &ndash; like most daunting tasks &ndash; that a small number of simplicities reveal themselves behind the swirl of turbulence. Course participants will learn about various technologies of creativity &ndash; this, of course, is a pertinent and pressing matter &ndash; but the course workshop is not, primarily, another introduction to blogging, social networking, web content, and viral marketing. These are only the outer appearance &ndash; the carapace, the shell &ndash; of what amounts to a re-imagining of what it means to be a creative person in the world today.</p>
<p>Creative Writing 1240 is a course about reclaiming the fundamental right of creative endeavour and choosing the paths that lead forward.</p>
<p>Freedom, adventure, opportunity: these are the watchwords of the contemporary creative professional. Every age calls its inhabitants to action. How do we know this? Writers tell us. How do they tell us? By facing their own crises of confidence, by wrestling with the emerging norms and practices of their time, by seizing the word as their instrument and their stand. Why should we expect our age to be any different? Why would we want it to be?</p>
<h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
<p>The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creative inquiry is an interactive process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.</p>
<p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts and education: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our work together, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our contributions. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.</p>
<h2>Skill Development</h2>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s most helpful to come at creative writing in terms of a skill set. Thinking and acting creatively is really a matter of looking at the process of learning. Instead of focusing on the &ldquo;content&rdquo; we might ask questions about how we identify, interpret, create, and communicate this content. These are process questions. Below are some examples of the kinds of considerations we will explore during our process.</p>
<h3>Creating a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Question</h3>
<p>The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we&rsquo;re willing to accept as answers. What is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a creative question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they &ldquo;work&rdquo; on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.</p>
<h3>Critical Thinking and Crap Detection</h3>
<p>We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem &ldquo;authoritative.&rdquo; Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we&rsquo;re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of &ldquo;facts&rdquo;? And what are facts, anyway?</p>
<h3>Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we&rsquo;re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?</p>
<h3>Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)</h3>
<p>Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?</p>
<h3>Working in a Group</h3>
<p>Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy group process:</p>
<ul>
<li>building trust and a culture of collaboration</li>
<li>attending to individual needs and the needs of the group</li>
<li>sharing responsibility</li>
<li>giving and receiving feedback</li>
<li>embracing and resolving minor conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of our class time will be spent in small and large groups exploring and developing these skills.</p>
<h3>Following Through on a Process</h3>
<p>Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don&rsquo;t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it&rsquo;s helpful to think about the ecocycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there&rsquo;s a spark that feels like it&rsquo;s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess around with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; eventually comes, perhaps after a long &ldquo;winter&rdquo;. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.</p>
<p>What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?</p>
<h3>Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation</h3>
<p>Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment &mdash; that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone &mdash; do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.</p>
<p>Self-assessment involves asking questions such about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?</p>

<h3><span>Demonstration of Learning</span></h3>
<h3>Creative Compositions</h3>
<p>This is a writing course. Accordingly, you will write a minimum of 5 compositions of at least 600 words each. You may write more, if you like. There is no maximum. These compositions will be included in your digital portfolio (see below). The compositions can be in any genre and on any topic you choose. The goal is to choose a subject about which you are passionate and to write in a form and style that best further your literary passion. The compositions will be discussed in detail in class.</p>
<p>The compositions will conclude with a self-assessment of at least 500 words (which may be included in the digital portfolio or may be submitted separately). The self-assessment will include answers to the following questions (answers need not be itemized):</p>
<ul>
<li>What research did you do to prepare for your writing? Research might include readings, investigative interviews, online searches, self-reflections, ruminations, and many other modalities.</li>
<li>What learning resources did you use? These might include books, articles, online resources, and so on.</li>
<li>Of the research and readings you undertook, what impressed you as being most interesting or relevant?</li>
<li>What kinds of experiments did you undertake with your writing? How did you spend your time, and how did it go?</li>
<li>What went well, where did you struggle, and how do you feel about the process you undertook?</li>
<li>What were the best and worst moments of your writing? What did you learn from these moments?</li>
<li>Are you proud of your writing for this course? Is it your best work? What grade would you give yourself?</li>
<li>How might you improve your writing?</li>
<li>What did you learn about yourself while working on the compositions for this course?</li>
<li>How does what you learned apply to your studies at Kwantlen and to your sense of your future direction?</li>
<li>Do you plan to continue these compositions further, or to work on similar projects in the future?</li>
<li>You learned something crucial in these compositions which you won&rsquo;t discover for a while. Make a guess now about what that might be.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compositions are collectively worth 50 percent of your grade.</p>
<h4>Assessment Criteria for the Creative Compositions</h4>
<p>Projects for this course are focused on authentic and creative inquiry. Accordingly, the following criteria &ndash; which are based on the philosophy of creative inquiry &ndash; are used to evaluate engagement and commitment to the individual project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>
<li>Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes discomfort.</li>
<li>Openness to personal and interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Willingness to collaborate with others.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to approach academic inquiry as a skill with discrete steps and standards.</li>
<li>Commitment to improvement in writing and creative work.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above criteria, compositional criteria are also used to evaluate your writing, as follows (in percentages):</p>
<dl><dt><span class="math-first">80 &minus; 100</span></dt><dd>
<p>Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and vigorous. The writing invites reading; the work is well-crafted and grammatically flawless. The author is perceptive.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">76 &minus; 79</span></dt><dd>
<p>Very good: the use of language is generally correct. There may be a need for further editing. This could be in the presentation of the work (style, voice, characterisation, plot, point of view), or in the language (diction, grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation)&nbsp;&mdash; but the writing is involving.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">72 &minus; 75</span></dt><dd>
<p>Good: the author has created a manuscript with substantial content and without any serious errors in tone or narration. Problems with creative shaping and delivery may occur, and there may be a further need for learning the mechanics of language use, but generally, the problems do not interfere with the reader&rsquo;s appreciation of the work.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">68 &minus; 71</span></dt><dd>
<p>Manuscripts with repeated errors in grammar, usage or punctuation will result in a grade of no higher than 71 regardless of the proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative aspects of the work. On the other hand, manuscripts with no problems in grammar, usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than 71 if they fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges (of style or voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">64 &minus; 67</span></dt><dd>
<p>Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language (either in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in repeated errors in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the treatment of the material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The writing is potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the manuscript.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">60 &minus; 63</span></dt><dd>
<p>This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment without in any way exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as spelling mistakes, sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">56 &minus; 59</span></dt><dd>
<p>Below average: the writing is difficult to read because of inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or both. Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which the graded course was a pre-requisite.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="math">50 &minus; 55</span></dt><dd>
<p>Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of creative writing or has not tried.</p>
</dd></dl>
<h3>Group Project</h3>
<p>Each student will be a member of several different peer groups; each peer group will present at least one mini-presentation (roughly thirty minutes) on a topic of choice. Each class session after the second will involve presentations, with one presentation from each group. Class time will be given for preparing the presentations. The structure and content of the presentations will be discussed in class.</p>
<h4>Presentation Methods and Goals</h4>
<p>The central idea of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities to practice creative thinking and expression. As such, the presentation should be creative. Essentially, this means that you should try to use multiple presentation strategies and modalities. These might include (but are certainly not limited to) any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
<li>Music (playing)</li>
<li>Drumming</li>
<li>Singing</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Movement</li>
<li>Sport</li>
<li>Ritual</li>
<li>Film (showing)</li>
<li>Film making</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Web content</li>
<li>Craft work</li>
<li>Art making</li>
<li>Individual reflection</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Health practices</li>
<li>Creative process (any type)</li>
<li>Group communication</li>
<li>Cultural practices</li>
<li>Nature experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever possible (and workable), try to mix together multiple modalities into a single presentation. For example, you might ask the group to do some individual reflection using the modality of poetry, then create a series of movements based on the poetry, then work in small groups to talk about and share the process. Many configurations are possible. The trick is to choose an activity that you enjoy, then find a way to apply it to the content (suggested presentation topics are listed below). Please do not create your presentations using only written and/or spoken materials. In other words, don&rsquo;t just stand up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic. Utilize the energy of the group. Remember that in interdisciplinary work divergences are valued as unique opportunities. So, feel free to experiment with activities and modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand but which might, upon experiment, yield surprising connections and results. Be playful. Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage with the process in novel and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The presentations should (ideally) not be complete explanations or presentations of material. Feel free to play with challenging exercises, with impossible scenarios, and other conundra. One way to think about this is to consider insoluble riddles, such as the one in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>: Why is a raven like a writing desk?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Have you guessed the riddle yet?&rdquo; the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.<br />&ldquo;No, I give it up,&rdquo; Alice replied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea,&rdquo; said the Hatter.<br />&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said the March Hare.<br />Alice sighed wearily. &ldquo;I think you might do something better with the time,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best topics offer more questions than answers. They, are essentially, gateways into the mysterious &ndash; which, as Einstein will tell you, is an important place to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Suggested Topics for Presentations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tim Berners-Lee and the beginnings of the Web</li>
<li>Online privacy and identity</li>
<li>The cloud and what it means</li>
<li>Grassroots video and documentary making</li>
<li>The filter bubble</li>
<li>Why code is (or can be) beautiful)</li>
<li>Why word processors are evil</li>
<li>Hacking and cracking</li>
<li>Flash mobs and social media performances</li>
<li>The true meaning of Geek</li>
<li>SOPA, Copyright, and the future of creativity</li>
<li>Why digital text is better than printed text</li>
<li>Geolocation and community creativity</li>
<li>Content management systems (and which one to choose)</li>
<li>The meanings of Open, Free, Closed, and Proprietary</li>
<li>Free (as in beer) and free (as in speech)</li>
<li>Digital security (or, how to prevent your email from being hacked)</li>
<li>The W3C</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment for Group Presentations</h3>
<h4>Class and Instructor Assessment</h4>
<p>After each presentation, time will be set aside for class peers and the instructor to assess and give feedback on the presentations. Each group will design a rubric and questions for us to use in assessing each presentation. This feedback can sometimes be the most valuable part of the performance for everyone involved. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to see what worked, what landed with the audience and what didn&rsquo;t. This conversation can help the audience articulate struggles, questions and insights about what makes for an effective performance. By designing a rubric and questions for the audience to contemplate (either during or after the performance, depending on the goals and the presentation), you invite everyone to reflect on the nature and purpose of group sharing and performance.</p>
<h4>Self and Group Assessment</h4>
<p>This course utilizes experiential learning approaches which depend upon student involvement and active participation. Accordingly, the following criteria are used to evaluate overall participation and engagement in the group presentations and the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>
<li>Willingness to speak up and to lead.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Willingness to collaborate with others.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>The group presentations and overall course engagement are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.</p>
<h3>Online Community Project</h3>
<p>We will create an online component of the course for us to share ideas, resources, and conversations. Your contribution to this online community will represent your online community project, and will include weekly contributions (at least one comment or contribution per week). The assessment criteria for this project are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extent and appropriateness of online contributions</li>
<li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>
<li>Willingness to lead and contribute positively to online conversations.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process in the online sphere.</li>
<li>Willingness to collaborate with others online.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others online.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the online group.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments in the context of online conversation.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning and learning technologies.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with online conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to give and receive appropriate online feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>The online community project is worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.</p>
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of authentic and interdisciplinary inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.</p>
<p>Creative inquiry is a unique process. Unlike many other fields, in which competence and skill may be measured objectively, using replicable and consistent means (tests of factual knowledge, for example), authentic creative inquiry depends greatly on the interpersonal skills of the practitioner. Computer programmers can be assessed by their ability to write code; chiropractors can be evaluated based on their skill at manipulating the human skeleton; race car drivers can be clocked around a track. But for interdisciplinary scholars there are no such fixed measures. The interpersonal skills of authentic creative inquiry are subtle, difficult to quantify, and complex beyond any measurement scheme.</p>
<p>And yet we can identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, kind (Jacob Bronowski is probably the best modern example). Often they exhibit skills that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to the development of self-awareness.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I feeling right now?</li>
<li>What am I thinking right now?</li>
<li>Why am I reacting in this particular way?</li>
<li>What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?</li>
<li>Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?</li>
<li>Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?</li>
<li>When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?</li>
<li>In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you. At the very least, you might wish to consider what you are currently working on in your life, in which direction your attention is drawn, into which of the innumerable themes of human nature you are now called to delve.</p>
<p>In my role as your instructor, I will be paying attention to how thoughtful you are in examining and responding to questions like those in the lists above. I will not be analyzing you, but rather noticing what kinds of things you do, what your reactions are to various situations. My goal in observing your behaviors and interacting with you is to assist you in developing greater self-awareness (and, by extension, greater creativity).</p>
<p>I will use the lists above, as well as the assessment criteria listed for each assignment, to assess your overall participation in the course. I will not be evaluating your level of self-awareness but rather your openness to the process of developing your self-awareness.</p>
<h3>Grade Inflation</h3>
<p>Almost every semester there are students who do well on the assignments, complete all the associated learning goals of the course, participate well, and wonder why they do not receive a grade of one hundred percent (or 98, anyway). Here is the reason: almost every semester there are students who demonstrates a level of commitment that goes beyond the course requirement. Such students complete extra work, or hand in exemplary assignments, or undertake a significant amount of personal development in addition to the course expectations. Such students typically receive the highest grades.</p>
<p>If you do reasonably well in the course you will receive a reasonable grade. Very high grades are intended for extra or exemplary work. Unfortunately, over the past thirty years the post-secondary educational system in North America has participated in a process of grade inflation. Since the 1980&rsquo;s, the average grade for typical course work has been increasing by about 25 per cent each decade. Elevated assessments do not accurately reflect the work of most students. Even worse, grade inflation has caused many students to expect high grades for average work. I am not a overly stringent assessor; but I will not inflate grades artificially.</p>
<p>In this course a small number of students will (likely) receive high grades; most students will receive grades in the middle range; and a few students will struggle with lower grades. If you are uncertain about your assessment for a given assignment, or if you wish to know where, roughly, you are along the distribution curve of the class, or if you would like suggestions for how to improve your grade, please ask me for clarification.</p>
<p>If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show up for class &ndash; every class. This course depends on student engagement. (This becomes especially important during the final weeks of the semester.)</li>
<li>Contribute consistently to the online community and respond to the contributions of others.</li>
<li>Be attentive and mindful to the various criteria listed for each of the projects and the course overall.</li>
<li>Take the initiative to plan and develop your projects and presentations. This course is (very likely) more fluid and spontaneous than you are used to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is crucial.</li>
<li>Speak up in every class (review the criteria for group engagement and presentations).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead, find the answer that is meaningful to you.</li>
<li>Ask for help if you need it.</li>
<li>Commit to your projects in a substantial way. Good projects take time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, please be attentive to the Kwantlen policies on <a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/__shared/assets/Honesty1432.pdf">academic honesty</a> and <a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/policies/C-LearnerSupport/c08.pdf">plagiarism</a>.</p>
<h2>Due Dates</h2>
<p>Group presentation dates will be assigned in class (and will fall between weeks three and thirteen).</p>

<h3>How to Start Writing</h3>
<p>Stop whatever else you are doing. Close your email application and Facebook, turn off the background music, silence your cell phone. Put it all away. Do it now. I&rsquo;ll wait.</p>
<p>Sit in silence, without distraction, and read this post. Silence the part of you that makes false claims about the utility of background music or the necessity of leaving your cell phone turned on. Silence the part of you that wants to argue with me, right now, about my unreasonableness, the part of you that makes claims for this or that distraction. Still the monkey mind that never shuts up, never stops talking, never ceases inventing new ways to jostle, cajole, argue. Stop arguing and listen: the voice of a writer can only be found within silence.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Start with that. Stay within it. Allow it to grow around you, to blossom, to disclose the images and words that inhabit the landscape of your inner life. Don&rsquo;t control it, or direct the flow of that nascent energy. Sit, and read, and watch yourself.</p>
<p>Forget that you are trying to write. This fact is irrelevant to the creative process. It is a curiosity. A writer finds and follows the creative voice. The means by which this happens, the structure in which it unfolds, the particulars of the path: these are secondary and inconsequential. A writer follows the path, whenever it appears and wherever it leads.</p>
<p>A writer does not invent or create the writing. Instead, the act of authentic writing leads the writer. Accordingly, the task of the writer is to find &ndash; within &ndash; the stream, thread, and path of creative energy. Writing inhabits its own life, is its own animal, is a being struggling to be free of the cages we build around it. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it. Find the cage, find the animal.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Stop arguing. Your arguments, like mine, only serve to strengthen the cage. The animal of the creative is not swayed by our smartness, our wit, our experiences. It does not care how many books we have read or how many fancy words we know. It is not interested in our expertise and the many ways in which we layer our insecurities one over the other.</p>
<p>The animal of the creative wanders the landscape of gods and heroes. The animal has seen things we no longer remember. The animal is what we once were but have chosen to cage as a means of protecting ourselves from the vastness of what we cannot grasp, the depths into which we no longer dare to gaze.</p>
<p>The creative animal is primordial, eternal, wise beyond our knowing. It has been waiting for us, all this time. Listen to what it has to say.</p>
<p>Write.</p>
<p>Allow the creative animal to write for you one good word, or sentence, or paragraph. Don&rsquo;t mess up the writing. It is difficult to say what this means, this messing up. Perhaps you are cool, or smart, or erudite. Forget all that crap. It is meaningless. Write honestly. Let the creative animal speak through you.</p>
<p>If, as you write, you start to worry about what people might think of your writing, you may as well not start. Give it up now, before you waste any more time. Or tell the part of you that wants to be a rabbit rather than a wolf to shut the hell up.</p>
<p>Write something. Don&rsquo;t worry about what genre it is. Genres have no meaning. Writing &mdash; all writing &mdash; is, at heart, an extended negotiation with the creative animal. That animal is partly you, yes; but is also not you, is wholly an emissary of that mystery we run from and slide toward.</p>
<p>And the animal is &mdash; for the most part &mdash; silent. Do not forget this. Words are not the creative, cannot be the creative, will never be the creative. They are echoes. Treat them as such. Find the source of those echoes.</p>
<p>Find the cage. Find the animal.</p>
<h3>Steps to Better Writing</h3>
<p>The oldest and greatest poems, epics, and songs &ndash; the original roots and branches of all literature &ndash; are articulated visions. They are dreams, glimpses of other worlds (real or imagined), archetypes of clear seeing. This clarity of vision defines good literature, and is therefore the ultimate aim of practicing writers. Yet various impediments arise to obscure our sight, the way a bank of low-lying cloud hides a shoreline glistening with pebbles. As writers, sometimes we become disoriented by the many conflicting tools of our craft, by contrary examples and advice, by the spinning compasses of style and voice. Our path becomes uncertain, the shore distant, vision muddied.</p>
<p>And yet the shore is not far, and reaching it requires only a steadfast purpose; and, of course, awareness of the fog. To dispel that fog we must avoid its common traps, which are our own habits in disguise. Below are the most common. Find them in your work, excise them, clear your vision.</p>
<h4>Tip 1: Use concrete imagery</h4>
<p>The writer is a ruminative animal (like a cow, in fact). We chew over our lives and histories, we digest and express the stories to which we are drawn. This process requires a good deal of thought. Writers think &ndash; cogitate speculate, perambulate &ndash; and we write down our thoughts. Yet we forget, often, that the reader does not have access to our mind, does not perceive the interconnections and contexts which lead us to our conclusions. We must show the reader that context, the web of threads and images by which we derive our narratives. And this requires that we replace our inner ruminations with concrete imagery.</p>
<p>On its own, unaccompanied by imagery, <em>I am sad</em> is poor writing. The reader is offered no means by which to understand the cause or nature of the sadness. The writer must provide the path to understanding by way of imagery. Typically, the rule for this situation involves four or five concrete images for each internal rumination. Like so:</p>
<p><em>Sheets of rain strike the window. I gaze into the dark, searching for the glimmer of proud trees across the field. Too dark to see anything. The house, empty now, twists and groans in the sidelong wind. Every whisper of its movement reminds me of the sad night ahead.</em></p>
<p>In the above passage, <em>sad</em> is embedded within imagery, layered, integrated. It is not a rumination but a concrete indication of feeling. And it comes in the last of five sentences, thus proving the rule. This rule also has another name: Show, Don't Tell.</p>
<h4>Tip 2: Use the present tense</h4>
<p>Even when writing about the past, the present tense is usually the best route to clarity. Other tenses and moods require more words, encourage abstraction, and introduce a barrier between the immediacy of the reader and the distance of the text. These problems are most evident when writers use the subjunctive mood (or tense), which is defined as follows:</p>
<p><em>Subjunctive: a mood that represent an act or state (not as a fact but) as contingent or possible.</em></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the subjunctive mood uses words such as <em>if, that, though, lest, unless, except, until</em> and so on. But in a more general way, the subjunctive mood, or tense, might be described as any writing that removes the reader from the concrete and present tense:</p>
<p><em>I wish my dog were here.<br /> If Dave were stronger, he would have been able to lift the tree stump.<br /> If I had paid more attention to my instructor's tips about creative writing, I would be a better writer.<br /> I requested that John be present at the wedding.</em></p>
<p>The above examples illustrate various ways in which subjunctive approaches to writing introduce extra words and awkward phrases. Replacing these with concrete phrases in the present tense improves the writing:</p>
<p><em>My dog is here.<br /> Dave is not strong enough the lift the stump.<br /> I listen to my creative writing instructor.<br /> My writing improves.<br /> John comes to the wedding.</em></p>
<p>Here is a short list of words and phrases that often accompany writing that meanders away from the present tense and from concrete imagery. Avoid these words and phrases whenever possible:</p>
<p><em>there would/could, were/was, has/had, those/these, that/this</em></p>
<h4>Tip 3: Avoid adverbs and gerunds</h4>
<p>A gerund is a noun formed from a verb: <em>walking</em>, for example. Gerunds usually end in <em>ing</em>, and avoiding them is one of the single most positive changes a writer can make. Gerunds are problematic for two reasons: they encourage adverbs and they drift toward abstraction (see tips one and two).</p>
<p>For example, a writer may describe a scene of walking as follows:</p>
<p><em>I was walking down the street, quickly, not paying too much attention to the hurtling traffic and the shop-keepers shouting stridently from their stalls.</em></p>
<p>This vignette is neither in the present tense (and is therefore less concrete than it might be) nor is it crisp and clear enough. As soon as the writer begins with the gerund <em>walking</em>, all the other adverbs and gerunds in the sentence follow naturally; awkwardly and naturally. Gerunds, therefore, imply adverbs and abstraction. Also, gerunds require more words and tenses: <em>was walking</em> requires two words to state a simple verb. Here's how to reduce the confusion:</p>
<p><em>I walk down the street. My steps are quick, my attention wanders. I do not notice the hurtling traffic, nor the shouts of strident shop-keepers as I pass their stalls.</em></p>
<p>The revised passage is more immediate, possesses an air of expectation (of suspense, almost), is constructed with precision, and contains no extra words. The revision begins with a present tense action: <em>I walk down the street</em>. The remainder of the passage builds naturally, preserves the original clarity. Better. Stronger.</p>
<p>Like gerunds, adverbs &ndash; typically words that end in <em>ly</em> &ndash; introduce abstraction and encourage awkward phrasings. An adverb qualifies a verb, limits or augments the verbal meaning. As such, an adverb serves the same function as a bank of fog laid across a shoreline. The fog obscures, mediates, filters. Almost always, adverbs may be replaced with more accurate verbs and fewer words; as in the example above, with the adverb <em>quickly</em> replaced by the verb <em>quick</em> and a concrete image of the steps of the walker.</p>
<p>Gerunds and adverbs are not always avoidable. They are necessary at times, and need not be shunned entirely. But often they are lazy solutions. Avoid them whenever feasible.</p>
<h4>Tip 4: Tune your vocabulary</h4>
<p>Writing is not speech. And yet the habits of speech tend to infiltrate writing. Resist this whenever possible: look for these infiltrations, replace them with narrative structures, preserve the clarity of your vision. For example, <em>I am not a farmer, and I do not eat broccoli</em> is better than <em>I'm not a farmer, and I don't eat broccoli</em>. Apostrophes derive from speech, and are usually to be avoided in writing (except in the case of possessives, obviously). In similar fashion, it is best to limit the use, in writing, of the following common and conversational words:</p>
<p><em>really, very, it, quite, real, some, somehow, someone, something, everything, thing, anyone, maybe, little, been, your, never, always, only, just, deep, people, about, being, guess</em></p>
<p>The vocabulary of a writer need not be coruscating or arcane or hermetic. Small and common words will do, and in most cases should do. Small words encourage precision and clarity. The order of such words, the manner in which they are structured as narrative and not as speech, determines much of the quality of writing.</p>
<h4>Tip 5: Know your habits</h4>
<p>In addition to the various strategies outlined above, writers also need to be aware of their individual proclivities: their habits of laziness, their favorite and over-used words, the ways in which they sacrifice clarity for muddiness. The following are the most common secondary errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awkward phrase order in compound sentences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awkward shifts of scene or tense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awkward use of vocabulary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of clear narrative direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stating the obvious rather than showing through imagery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These habits and their kin &ndash; the many pitfalls and hurdles that lie along the path of writing &ndash; are avoided only through practice. Go slow, review each sentence as you write, make a list of your common errors and search for each error as you compose. Remember the primary goal: clarity.</p>
<h3>Tip 6: Build Sentences Step by Step</h3>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to break things down into manageable steps. Here are some steps to consider in starting your compositions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sit comfortably. Turn down thoughts. Relax. Enter into a contemplative mood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider what you are trying to express in the sentence you are about to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the sentence. At this stage, don&rsquo;t worry about details. Simply write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the sentence. Look for obvious problems, and find what you like most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your sentence contains the best words for what you are trying to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine the phrase order. Look for a tighter order, more spare or visceral or elegant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak the sentence aloud. Find its rhythm and sonority. Tweak as required. Don't rush.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take out all extra words and lazy phrasings, especially those that are habitual. Excise adverbs, gerunds, and verb phrases ("there is...", "I've done...", "We're going...") whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shorten the sentence if you can (without diminishing its meaning).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a short break, gaze out the window, return to the sentence, and review it once more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave it alone. Build your next sentence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
