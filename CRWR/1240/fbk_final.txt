I enjoyed your presence, participation, and enthusiasm in this class. You contributed well, you helped the class discover and explore various aspects of new and social media, and you were reliably thoughtful about the role that new technologies should (or should not) play in our lives.

Overall, very nicely done. Your portfolio is coming along -- though please do continue to think about ways to deepen your presence online.

Group presentations: 22

So, overall, well done. I'm glad you were in the class, and I hope to see you in future classes.
