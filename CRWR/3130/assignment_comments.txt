Hi ...;

A very interesting, entertaining, and thoughtful piece. I appreciated the color and mood of it. A good effort, and well done.

A couple of suggestions:

1. Keep working on tightening. Look for extra words and different ways of expressing ideas that are closer to speech than writing.

2. Also with regard to tightening: try to insert a few more small punctuating sentences here and there, to focus the reader on small but important themes or images. (You already do this somewhat.)

3. Read your work aloud a couple of times. Try to do this with each sentence and paragraph. This helps a great deal with rhythm -- though, your rhythm is already quite good.

4. Try to use precise vocabulary in descriptions. Every time you use an adjective, or an adverb, ask yourself if there is a more precise way to express the image you are trying to convey. (This is related to the general theme of Show, Don't Tell.)

5. Think about verb tenses, particularly the present tense (consistency of which which would, I think, improve the immediacy of this piece).

Keep going. You are doing well.
23/25 for this assignment.
