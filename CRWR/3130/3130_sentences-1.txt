She runs fast for a corpulent woman.

The furrow of his brow, the dark cloud in his eyes, the anger caught
in the creases of his pinched mouth.

I want the sky to break open and cry with me but her hope is
relentless and her peaceful joy abounds and she presses her light on
my darkness.

The way his butt wiggles back and forth makes him resemble a
self-assured prostitute with a bad attitude.

And, when the train didn't stretch far enough, my brothers, my mom, my
dad, we got into the van with trail mix and water bottles, highway
Bingo cards can extra napkins, and we drove.

A sea of sneakers and slippers follows an ice cream truck as it blares
sing-songs around the corner.

As much as I try to contain her she has become an integral part of who
I am, and her bitterness leaks out of me so often that I forget that
she is not who I have to be, and so this trip calls to me to
rejuvenate my tired and aching soul.

We walk around the park and I tell her everything I want to say. I
tell her how sorry we are and explain what is going to happen. We come
to a bench and sit down together. Just then, a lady walks by and
comments on what a gorgeous dog I have. As she walks away I start to cry.

I tease the cat with the fringes of a garish crocheted afghan we keep on the left arm of the couch to hide the coffee stains.

Beside the colouring sheets are clear plastic containers full of Crayola crayons -- Wild Blue Yonder, Mango Tango, Granny Smith Apple, Torch Red, Razzmatazz, Tickle Me Pink.

I insert the bill into the slot like a surgeon making his first cut with a scalpel.

I look down at my reflection in the transparent screen. My eyes are bloodshot, my complexion is bone white.

The smell of dank earth and cold steel fills the kitchen.

My life, compared to my grandparents or even my parents, has been short in years.
