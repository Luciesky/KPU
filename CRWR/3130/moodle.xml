        <DESCRIPTION> My name, as you already know, is Kyle. I'm a fourth-year student working towards my BA in Journalism. I'm a huge pop culture fan; movies in particular. As far as favourite movies go, I love the work of Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), as well as others, like Almost Famous, A Mighty Wind, Big Fish and Dark Knight. Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire were fantastic too. My television favourites include Arrested Development, The Office and Lost.&lt;br /&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <DESCRIPTION>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;georgia,times new roman,times,serif&quot;&gt;Greetings. I'm Romy Kozak, and I'll be your instructor this term. I've been teaching at Kwantlen for about 4 years, with my areas of specialty being critical theory, cultural studies, and modern American literature. I'm originally from Vancouver, and obtained a B.A. (Honours) in English Literature at UBC. I left for a while, to get an M.A. in Critical Theory at the University of Sussex in England, and a Ph.D. in Modern Thought and Literature at Stanford University in the U.S. I moved back here in 2004 to be with family. Now I live in Yaletown, and I'm happy to be home!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <DESCRIPTION>&lt;p&gt;I am in my final year of my Journalism degree at Kwantlen. I am done all of the Journalism aspects of my degree, I am just finishing up my electives and Public Relations class. I can't wait to be finished and get into the workforce. I have yet to decide whether or not I want to go into PR or Journalism. I love them both, I guess it just depends on what kind of offers I get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to developing my writing through these classes and look forward to having more free time because they're all online haha.&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <DESCRIPTION>Hi everyone, my name is Edmond Au.  I'm currently working in Holt Renfrew and I have been in the retail business for 2 years.  My job is mostly based on selling, customer service, and product knowledge.  One of the key points to success is time management skill.

I'm currently taking 4 courses in Kwantlen this semester.  I'm hoping that I can finish my degree in Kwantlen within 2 years.  I do not have a plan after my university grad yet.  The reason of why I'm interested in Human Management is that it can apply to our everyday life.  Also it is very important to understand the technique structure of management so that we can work efficiently with other people in the company.

My definition of a &quot;good course&quot; will be about the connection between the materials that you have learn and how you can use it outside of the course. I'm currently taking ENGL 1100, CHEM 1101, PHYS 1101 and BUSI 1250.  After this semester, I will be finished my 60 credits requirement for the BA.

Personally I do not have any particular interests,but I do like shopping!  This is a way for me to release some pressure from work and school. I'm looking forward to meet more new people in this school year.  I hope I can meet some good team member from BUSI 1250.  I do not have any expectation to any team members, but I like people with quick responses and good communication.

Actually, I'm interest to study any chapter in the book.  I know we may not able to go through the whole book, but I hope I can learn the materials that I have learned and apply it to my daily life.

Hope everyone having a great and successful school year. cheers!</DESCRIPTION>

        <DESCRIPTION> Hello, there. I haven't been renting movies lately because I was recently given a bunch of free movie tickets that I keep meaning to use. I'll use them soon, when people stop thinking the theatre is the perfect place to go when they have the whooping cough or to catch up with an old classmate on the phone. Top rentals of late have all been television series: Six-Feet Under, Deadwood, Firefly, and Arrested Development.&lt;br /&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Melissa;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. (And work on your spelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

I should also say that I find the online mode to be a thoroughly inadequate mode for delivering the kind of teaching that I enjoy most: in-person, relational-oriented creative process. If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes. In these classes we work with creativity in a much more experiential way, by using movement, storytelling, film, poetry, music, yoga, hand-crafts, web technologies, and many other modalities. If you want more info, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. I should also say that I find the online mode to be a thoroughly inadequate mode for delivering the kind of teaching that I enjoy most: in-person, relational-oriented creative process. If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes. In these classes we work with creativity in a much more experiential way, by using movement, storytelling, film, poetry, music, yoga, hand-crafts, web technologies, and many other modalities. If you want more info, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Gillian;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe.

So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. I should also say that I find the online mode to be a thoroughly inadequate mode for delivering the kind of teaching that I enjoy most: in-person, relational-oriented creative process. If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes. In these classes we work with creativity in a much more experiential way, by using movement, storytelling, film, poetry, music, yoga, hand-crafts, web technologies, and many other modalities. If you want more info, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well (though the piece is very short!). And I think, finally, that the time is coming when you can leave this theme behind. I bet you'll like that. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Rebecca;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosphical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. I should also say that I find the online mode to be a thoroughly inadequate mode for delivering the kind of teaching that I enjoy most: in-person, relational-oriented creative process. If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes. In these classes we work with creativity in a much more experiential way, by using movement, storytelling, film, poetry, music, yoga, hand-crafts, web technologies, and many other modalities. If you want more info, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Daniel;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I finally got round to looking at your first assignment! Good job. You seem to be working diligently on your writing, and your narrative reflects that commitment. Here are a couple of suggestions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

This is good! Very personal and visceral. Excellent job. Sure, it could use a bit of tightening, but the overall tone is so direct and real that it works very well.

You already know most of your habits, so this part is just a matter of practice and attention.

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary.

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Tierney;

Apologies for not getting back to you about the pre-draft. I just got swamped by various things...

So, to this draft:

Holy crap, what a bunch of experiences! And well-told, also. Excellent pacing, and structure, and narrative flow. It's really a longer piece, of course, perhaps 10,000 words or a series of short stories. But that's for another version. As it stands it's very good.

Of course, I also have a few suggestions:

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing).

2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). In this draft, you tend to get stuck on messy and imprecise tenses and tense transitions (look for &quot;I'd&quot; and &quot;he'd&quot;). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves.

3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1).

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary. But not too much. You already do this quite well.

One more thing: Having such a large family shadow is good for a writer!

Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary. (Example: &amp;quot;yellow-ish teeth&amp;quot; could be something much more visceral and immediate.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Keep going!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cheers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ross&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing).

2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves.

3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1).

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary.

5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day.

&quot;Soft wing of darkness.&quot; That's very good. Did you find it, or make it? (Either way is fine... a writer steals, after all.)

Excellent job on this project. You seem to be working diligently on your writing, and your narrative reflects that commitment. Here are a couple of suggestions:

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself.

You already do this quite well; just a bit more would help just a bit...

5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day. (You probably do this already...)

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Kyle;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job (and a fun event!). Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image. This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length. Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write. This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Tenses. This seems to be a class-wide problem. You mix and shift tenses without noticing. If you read your work carefully you will see it. Work on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write. This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Tim;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job. Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed (look at your first paragraph for a good sample sentence for this exercise). The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece. Look at the punctuation also, and then look at your own punctuation (needs a bit of work...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image (sometimes you do this quite well already). This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length.

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Sarah;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This narrative is honest, and clear, and expressive. Good job. It must have been both difficult and cathartic to write. Think of it as a first draft of a longer piece, a book-length piece for example, about your experiences. This type of subject goes through various incarnations for the writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative.

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Amanda;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job. Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement.

Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image. This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length. Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write. This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Dave;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job. Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Also, it seems that this particular narrative is/was personally meaningful for you to write, and that's a very important principle to honor: my writing career is built upon that principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

              <FEEDBACK>Hi Rebecca;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason that I cannot fathom, it seems that I did not send you feedback about your second assignment! Sorry about that. I'm not at all sure what happened there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it's quite good. You can probably see, now, the advantage of rewriting a piece like this rather than resurrecting old copy. As you say, it requires a few more drafts of polishing; but it seems that the ethical question can be easily resolved (as we discussed), and the piece itself would do well in a professional environment (a magazine, say). Feel free to send me further drafts if and when you work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, apologies for not responding sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </FEEDBACK>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0185014/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Wonder Boys&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wonder Boys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0181536/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Finding Forrester&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding Forrester&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Adaptation&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adaptation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079596/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Brilliant Career&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102103/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Impromptu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impromptu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363988/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Secret Window&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Window&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100157/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Misery&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Misery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416508/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Becoming Jane&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becoming Jane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Barton Fink&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barton Fink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379725/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Capote&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these films I hope you will see both the persistence and delicacy of the craft of writing, the ways in which creativity might be stalled or jump-started, the strange turns that make the art of writing so compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have viewed your chosen film (or films), post your thoughts to the discussion forum for this week.&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Meditative Walking</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> Meditative Walking &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meditation takes many forms. Writing, in fact, is a form of meditation. So is walking, if we pay attention to the process. Many writers (including me) walk. You may be familiar with Stephen King's habit of daily walking (which was rudely interrupted, one day a few years ago, when he was run down by a van; later, King used a version of his experience in the final book of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gunslinger&lt;/span&gt; series). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This week I'm asking that each of us do a small bit of meditative walking. Take as little as ten minutes for this. Walk slowly. Turn down your thoughts. Be aware of your body, your movements, the images in your mind, the emotions in your body. Walk without a destination. Just walk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When you are finished walking, write something. Anything. Post it to the forum. Do not write in Word, then copy the text to the forum! Either write in the forum directly, or write in your text editor (then copy). Get out of the lazy habit of using a word processor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You may be interested, as part of this process, in taking a look at a few meditative walking resources on the web: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yogateacher.com/text/meditation/on-line/walking.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;mindfulness and walking&quot;&gt;Mindfulness and Walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.upliftprogram.com/meditation_walking.html&quot; title=&quot;feldenkrais walking&quot;&gt;Feldenkrais Walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buddhanet.net/xmed7.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;buddhist walking&quot;&gt;Buddhist walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/silananda/bl137.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;buddhist walking&quot;&gt;More Buddhist walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildmind.org/meditation/walking/little.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;buddhist walking&quot;&gt;Even more Buddhist walking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(No, your instructor is not a Buddhist; but Buddhism does have great walking meditations.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egreenway.com/meditation/walk.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;more walking links&quot;&gt;A huge page&lt;/a&gt; of walking resources. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Best Words</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> Take a look at your favourite books or essays or poems. Look for words, in those works -- rich words, words with many layers of meaning, sonorous words -- whatever catches your fancy. &lt;br /&gt;Make a list of your favourite words, gathered from literature and from your own writing. Share with us at least ten great words. Post them to the forum. And write something, too, about why you are so thoroughly seduced by such words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here's a short list of some of my favourites (with brief definitions for a few of the more erudite items); &lt;br /&gt;

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Sentence Postings</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> Words make sentences. In turn, sentences are the magic of writing. So, choose some of your favourites: from books, essays, poetry, or from your own writing. Post at least two outstanding sentences (from your point of view) that have been crafted by other writers. And write one sentence of your own. Make it as perfect as you can. Don't worry about how long or short it is. Consider it to be a tiny holograph of your writing life, a snippet, a haiku of your innermost visions. Post it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For this project, also try to start focusing on the types of sentences you might use in your major composition. The sentence (or sentences) you write for this week's project might embody the essence of your intended project. Write a paragraph or two, perhaps. Here's an example from my book on addictions, a vignette about a teenage girl who flees the turmoil of her home: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt;This child will awaken early, on a Tuesday morning. She will be fifteen years old. The house will be quiet, though as she dresses in the dark she will hear the sounds of someone rolling over in bed, down the hall and out of sight. The wind will come from the northwest, and will bring the scent of fir trees and salt water and mossy ground after the recent rains. She will gather her things in a small backpack~--- slim wallet, blue sweater, book with a tattered spine, four slices of beef jerky, can of root beer, journal with spiral designs on the cover, bag of toiletries, white envelope with photographs inside~--- and she will leave the house. She will not lock the back door. She will take the path that leads behind the house, she will cross the damp fields, and she will find the ribbon of highway that meanders beneath mountains in the east. She will not know her destination, nor what her next steps should be. She will walk at the roadside, listen for the sounds of cars approaching, gaze into the sky with its clouds scuttling across her vision. She will be entirely alone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A car will stop. Or she will flag down a bus, or a truck. And though many people from her community travel this road, none will do so this morning, and so no one will confront her, cajole her to return, report her escape to anyone who might come after her. It will be as though her world stands aside, and with closed eyes grants her passage. And in the space of that opening, in the crispness of the wind and by virtue of her own resolve, she moves forward unchallenged. No force delays or thwarts her. But she is afraid, and tentative, and she imagines the many ways in which her boldness might bring her harm. A light rain begins to fall. The roadside dust settles. She gazes down the highway, following with her eye the wide turn of the road and its disappearance over a shallow, saddled hill in the distance. She wonders where she will spend the night. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The healing of every community depends upon this child. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Twenty Themes</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> Review the list below. Choose a topic or question from the list. Write about it. Post your writing to the forum (also upload it to me through this assignment's page). If you have previously attended a Creative Writing class with me, you may recognize this list and you may have previously written a theme-based composition based on this list. If so, choose another theme or another permutation on the same theme for your composition. You will not be repeating material or duplicating your effort. The list, after all, contains essentially the complete archetypal themes of human psychology -- and therefore of literature -- so everything you will ever write can be encapsualted by a theme or set of themes from this list.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please post your composition before Friday, if possible, so that other participants have a chance to respond by the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;enumerate1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write something about yourself that no one else yet knows. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Describe a childhood memory in which you felt particularly empowered, or loved. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about one of your dreams. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Describe an experience you have had that you would define as spiritual. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Describe an experience in which you faced and overcame suffering. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Describe a humorous event in your life. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about something with which you are currently struggling. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about your own nature and talents, what are you good at? Where do you shine? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about one of your fears. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about the smell, or touch, or taste, or sound, that you love the most. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about something you know deeply. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;If you could change one thing about the world, what would it be? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;What does your shadow look like, or sound like? What does it say? How does it write? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about something you believe. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;When you are feeling weak and vulnerable, what must you remember? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;What is your favorite book, or story, or film, or poem, or painting? Why? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Describe one thing you feel is necessary for you to do before you die. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Who do you love? Why? Write about this. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Write about something else. &lt;/li&gt;

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Tierney;

Apologies for not getting back to you about the pre-draft. I just got swamped by various things...

So, to this draft:

Holy crap, what a bunch of experiences! And well-told, also. Excellent pacing, and structure, and narrative flow. It's really a longer piece, of course, perhaps 10,000 words or a series of short stories. But that's for another version. As it stands it's very good.

Of course, I also have a few suggestions:

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing).

2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). In this draft, you tend to get stuck on messy and imprecise tenses and tense transitions (look for &quot;I'd&quot; and &quot;he'd&quot;). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves.

3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1).

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary. But not too much. You already do this quite well.

One more thing: Having such a large family shadow is good for a writer!

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Sarah;

Nice job. Very personal and honest. This type of approach is reliably effective (and hard to do!).

Here are a couple of suggestions:

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion.

3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1).

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary.

5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day.

&quot;Soft wing of darkness.&quot; That's very good. Did you find it, or make it? (Either way is fine... a writer steals, after all.)

4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary. You already do this quite well; just a bit more would help just a bit...

5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day. (You probably do this already...)

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Chantelle;

Good job. You seem to be working diligently on your writing, and your narrative reflects that commitment. Here are a couple of suggestions:

1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing).

2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves.

You seem to be working diligently on your writing, and your narrative reflects that commitment. Here are a couple of suggestions: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Focus on trying to get yourself out of the way. As I've been mentioning to various people in our group, the writer should be invisible, essentially, even when you are writing about yourself. There should be no screen between the reader and the text, no intermediary. Put the reader in the scene. Show rather than tell. Bring the scene alive through description and immersion. Be the scene (that sounds abstract, I know, but it's a sort of Zen satori thing in writing). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep tightening. Review the tightening package for the course. Review the suggestions I have already made about your specific style (look in the forum). Everyone tends to make the same several mistakes; correcting these is a large part of how a writer improves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Explore the possibility of making your writing just a little more raw, or real, or visceral. I don't mean that you should try to make it more shocking, but rather more immediate (see point 1). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Work on word replacement. Review every sentence and look for words that you might replace with other, more resonant words. It's easy to over-do this, but it's more common not to do it enough. Just replace a few words. Turn blue into azure, or tree into spruce, or car into 1969 Shelby Cobra. You get the idea. More variety and color in your vocabulary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Keep going. Just practice writing more, and more, and more. Try for about 50,000 words over the next year or so. That should help quite a bit. And 50,000 is not that much; 137 words per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Parable Completions</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> Here are two parables. The first is from Tibetan Buddhism, the second from the Brothers Grimm. Read each of them. Finish the stories they tell. Make your narratives as long or as short as you like. Post your results in the forum. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionHead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;titlemark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Parable of the Warrior Princess &lt;br /&gt;(Adapted from Tibetan Buddhism) &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;!--l. 502--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;A young warrior princess completed her training under a renowned teacher and was accorded the title &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Princess of Five Weapons&lt;/span&gt;. Armed appropriately, and embodying her forty-two virtues, she set out on the road leading to the eternal city. &lt;!--l. 504--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The road led the princess west, across the wide desert and into a forest. At twilight she reached the first trees, where she found other travelers who warned her to turn back. They spoke in fearful tones about an ogre, an eater of hearts, who lurked along the most shadowed paths, killing all those who happened by. But the princess was confident of her training. Fearless, she pressed on. &lt;!--l. 506--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; At a dark place, where branches overhung a stagnant stream, the ogre emerged from the underbrush. It was a phantom, a wraith, a brute with crushing hands. The princess deployed her five weapons, but the ogre was strong (and crafty) — one by one, the weapons of the princess were defeated. But she did not relent. After each weapon was spent and lay broken on the ground, the princess resumed the battle, challenging the ogre again and again. &lt;!--l. 508--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Finally, the ogre paused, and asked her, “Youth, why are you not afraid?” &lt;!--l. 510--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; “Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life, death is absolutely certain. What’s more,”… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionHead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;titlemark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The Golden Key &lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;(Last Tale of the Brothers Grimm) &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;!--l. 514--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Once in the wintertime when the snow was very deep, a poor boy had to go out and fetch wood on a sled. After he had gathered it together and loaded it, he did not want to go straight home, because he was so frozen, but instead decided to make a fire and warm himself a little first. So he scraped the snow away, and while he was clearing the ground he found a small golden key. Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also be a lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest. “If only the key fits!” he thought. “Certainly there are valuable things in the chest.” He looked, but there was no keyhole. Finally he found one, but so small that it could scarcely be seen. He tried the key, and fortunately it fitted. Then he turned the lock once, the lid popped open, and in the chest the boy saw… &lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

        <NAME>Weekly Activity: Collaborative Creativity Exercises</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION>
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionHead&quot;&gt;Partner Exercises &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are exercises for exploring collaborative aspects of the creative process. Choose two exercises (or more!), find a friend -- another member of the class, ideally, or perhaps a spouse, or a peer, or a stranger on the street -- and give the exercises a try. After you have completed your chosen exercises, compose a non-fiction narrative inspired by or based upon the work you accomplished in the exercises. Post your results and reflections in the forum. You narrative may be of any chosen length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--l. 492--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;enumerate1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner for three words. Incorporating these three words, write one paragraph of a myth. Share it with your partner. Discuss the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner to make or describe three movements. Based on the three movements, write the story they tell. Feel free to embellish. Read to or show your partner what you created. Discuss the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner to make or describe three sounds. Adapting the three sounds, and other sounds and words of your own, write a song. Share the song with your partner (sing it if you like!). Discuss the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner to describe three images. Using the three images, compose a story about how the world began. Share the story with your partner. Discuss the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner to describe two smells and two tastes. Using the smells and tastes (and others of your own choosing), write a non-rhyming poem of about 12-20 lines. Share the poem with your partner. Discuss the process. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;enumerate&quot;&gt;Ask your partner to describe one memory. Using the memory as your own, write your own version. Share this version with your partner. Discuss the process. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;!--l. 499--&gt;

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Caprice;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job. Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image. This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length. Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Tenses. This seems to be a class-wide problem. You mix and shift tenses without noticing. If you read your work carefully you will see it. Work on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write. This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image. This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length. Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write. This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Kyle;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job (and a fun event!). Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence.

Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.

Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision. You want to make your narrative clean, light, and lean. Pick up a copy of the most current Vanity Fair (guys in barrels on the cover) and read the piece by William Langewiesche. You will find few, if any, removable words in that piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Color. Look for small items of interest to spruce up every sentence. These might be interesting objects, or observations, or small moments. Each sentence should be a tiny poem that, when read on its own, delivers a particular mood or image. This is another way of saying that every sentence must advance the narrative. In a well-crafted narrative, every sentence carries the entire narrative. This is the holographic principle of good writing (and was employed by Shakespeare, among others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Length. Try to extend your narrative (eventually) so that it occupies a substantial spread of pages: ten, twelve, twenty, fifty, and so on. Many people struggle to make it past five pages. It's like running: first the 10K, then the half-marathon, then the marathon, then (for a few) the ultra. Writers tend to work toward the ultra (i.e. a book), and this is mostly accomplished by writing narratives of increasing length over time. This is a larger project, but one that I suggest for the sake of creative development. Write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Enjoyment. Your narrative seems to have been enjoyable to write (or, at least insightful or cathartic). This is an important principle, even when dealing with tough subjects. It's about lightness again. Keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And keep going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Sarah;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This narrative is honest, and clear, and expressive. Good job. It must have been both difficult and cathartic to write. Think of it as a first draft of a longer piece, a book-length piece for example, about your experiences. This type of subject goes through various incarnations for the writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed. The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative.

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Dave;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed your second assignment. Good job. Your writing is improving, and you seem to be growing more comfortable with the writer's voice -- the voice that gets you, the person, out of the way. That's a definite improvement. Also, it seems that this particular narrative is/was personally meaningful for you to write, and that's a very important principle to honor: my writing career is built upon that principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few more thoughts regarding items to continue working on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Language. After you have written a sentence, go back and review it a few times. Look for any words that might be removed (look at your first paragraph for a good sample sentence for this exercise). The trick is to remove any words that do not directly advance the narrative. Words must earn their place: they must add color, or feeling, or atmosphere. They cannot be stow-aways that occupy space but do not deliver light. All stow-aways should be removed. This removal process is the central task of editing and revision.

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Rebecca;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason that I cannot fathom, it seems that I did not send you feedback about your second assignment! Sorry about that. I'm not at all sure what happened there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it's quite good. You can probably see, now, the advantage of rewriting a piece like this rather than resurrecting old copy. As you say, it requires a few more drafts of polishing; but it seems that the ethical question can be easily resolved (as we discussed), and the piece itself would do well in a professional environment (a magazine, say). Feel free to send me further drafts if and when you work on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, apologies for not responding sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

        <NAME>The Final Project</NAME>
        <DESCRIPTION> The final project will require sustained focus and effort. This is why you have a total of three weeks to work on it. Please review the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Start Here &lt;/span&gt;entry from the beginning of the course if you are unsure about how long the final project should be. As I write this, I'm thinking about William Langeweische's &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fear and Lodging&lt;/span&gt; essay, which seems about the perfect length for its content. (The essay is roughly 4,000 words long.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For your own essay, start with a theme: a family story, an observation about nature, an experience that affected you. Where you start matters less than where you go (on the other hand, you should start out as you plan to go on...). But wherever you go, however the essay unfolds, focus on developing the tightness and clarity of your prose. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Ask me for help if you get stuck, or don't know where to start, or start out and become mired in the various mucky things writers seem prone to. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Write well. This is the goal. Not the grade, nor the brevity of your effort, nor aims of publishing, nor any other consideration. Just the writing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Submit your final project to me, and also post it on the forum. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Melissa;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. (And work on your spelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes.

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Amanjit;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments.

            <SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>Hi Ash;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for waiting (two weeks!) to hear back from me about your final assignment. I don't usually take this long. However, at the moment (as you may have heard) there are various evolving developments at Kwantlen, and I have found myself involved with a few of them. With regard to the Creative Writing department in particular, we are undertaking various new initiatives now that Kwantlen has achieved university status. I can't say much about these initiatives at the moment, other than to say that they have consumed all of my marking time over the past couple of weeks. So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too short (you lost a point for that), but beautifully done. Your craft is coming along very nicely. If you haven't yet decided whether you want to be a professional writer, you should do so soon. Life has a way of taking over when we don't decide, and paving a way when we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

So, apologies again; it's an interesting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to your assignment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done. A good blend of personal narrative, philosophical rumination, and developing craft. Your language is more evocative, more precise, and in general is coming along well. I found the darker mood quite effective. Here are a couple of items for further development:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep focusing on making some of your sentences as concise as possible: allow no extra words at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep trying to get yourself out of the way. When you write about yourself, imagine that you view yourself from the outside, not from the inside. This can be tough to get right, and is tough to describe. You are not writing about yourself, but rather the person that is you (another Zen thing...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep practicing. That's what it's all about, really. Just more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being in the class. I enjoyed reading your comments, thoughts, and assignments. I should also say that I find the online mode to be a thoroughly inadequate mode for delivering the kind of teaching that I enjoy most: in-person, relational-oriented creative process. If you are interested in such things, feel free to explore the Mythological Narratives class and the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts classes. In these classes we work with creativity in a much more experiential way, by using movement, storytelling, film, poetry, music, yoga, hand-crafts, web technologies, and many other modalities. If you want more info, please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, thanks again for joining our online group. I will be posting final grades this weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </SUBMISSIONCOMMENT>

                <MESSAGE>Hi all;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust you are enjoying your movie viewing and reviewing. (By the way, the film that has been getting all the media buzz this week -- the Wrestler -- was directed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Aronofsky#Batman_project&quot;&gt;Darren Aronofsky&lt;/a&gt;, the same guy who directed The Fountain, one of the films on our list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to complete your views and reviews within the next day or so, and please respond to at least two posts from other members of our group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coming week (January 12 through January 18) involves the topic of tools: pens, text editors, and so on. You may not think that the tool you use makes a great difference; but indeed it does, which is why we will talk about tools this week, before we do much actual writing. Some of the material posted for this week is perhaps a bit technical (depending on how much you know about computers), so feel free to gloss over the technical bits if they seem too arcane for you. But at the very least, make sure you make an effort to understand why migrating away from Word might be a good idea. And try -- at least -- to write your reflections for the week (based on the walking exercise) in Notepad, or whatever text editor comes with your system. If you feel brave, try Emacs, Vim, or one of the other suggestions for the weekly resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing: this is the second version of this posting that I have written. I broke my own rule and wrote the first version straight into moodle's text window. Then, as I was writing ...&amp;quot;try -- at least -- to write your reflections in ...&amp;quot; I accidentally hit the Back button and lost the entire post. Live, learn, and learn again. I am now writing in Emacs (which is what I usually do), which has a handy auto-backup function so that even if the power goes out right now, every letter that I type will be saved. Much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will select the full text of this post (Ctrl-x h), copy it (Ctrl-w), then paste it (Shift-insert) into the moodle window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

Hi folks;

I am sure you are all out walking meditatively, trying to still the urgent thoughts that provoke you to switch to Emacs. When you return from your walk, please notice that the content for the coming week is now available. Try to complete your comments and contributions about the walking exercise within a day or so, and move to the next exercise (words).

Also, I have already begun to suggest small changes to various posts, just as a way of introducing you to ideas about compositional improvement (also called tightening). Toward that end, I have attached to this post (and also attached to the content for the week) an important course document: On Tightening. Please print this out and carry it with you wherever you go: reviewing, memorizing, integrating. It is the most important material for the course. (I don't really mean carry it with you everywhere, but if you want to...)

Cheers.

                <MESSAGE>Hi folks;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted the material for this coming week. I hope you notice the pattern: words (last week) to sentences (this week). We are approaching actual writing. Indeed, you will be completing at least some small amount of writing in the coming week in the form of sentence composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to finish up your contributions to the word lists by tomorrow. In general, try to post your contributions by Friday of a given week, so that other members of the group have the opportunity to respond before we move on to the next week. Also, if you post on Saturday or Sunday, I may not have an opportunity to respond before I need to shift my own instructional focus to the upcoming week. So aim for Friday, or Thursday, or earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Thursday, I will be in Toronto from Thursday through Sunday. I am a member of the National Council of the Writers' Union of Canada, which is the organization you will join if you become a professional author in Canada. TWUC manages the professional environment of writers in Canada, lobbies the government for arts funding, collaborates with other groups to explore and maintain cultural ties to the writing community, and so on. TWUC is the only national organization for professional book authors in Canada. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will be meeting with that group for four full days, and I do not yet know how much online access I will have. So, I have tried to make the course materials for this week reasonably light, so that you can work away without too much interference from me. I will try to post from Toronto; but if I am unable to do so, I will be back online next Monday. (I will be available online for the next three days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have added a new forum for you to post about your readings. Please add whatever you think is relevant; a few details, at least, of what you are reading and what you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading and writing. That's the life of a writer in a nutshell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[crafted cheerfully in Emacs]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Why I Hate Airport Lobbies</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>Hi folks;

I am (finally) back from Toronto, and I must apologize for not responding to posts within the last couple of days (for the reason, see below). I have posted the content for the week, and I have created (just now) a small theme example which mirrors the type of process we're working on this week (see below). The coming week is actually quite busy for us, so please do take some time today or tomorrow to get started. I should be able to get caught up with my posting within a day or two (here's hoping).

Here's my little tongue-in-cheek &quot;theme example&quot;:

Why I Hate Airport Lobbies 

I routinely travel long distances for my work. This typically involves a ride on an airplane and the concomitant long lines waiting for services that seem inefficient and unnecessary. The delays, the small but important details of gates and boarding passes and acceptable identification; the subliminal anxiety behind ground travel in shuttle buses and taxis; the moment of panic when they can't find my name on the reservation list at the hotel lobby: all of these things contribute to a generalized disorientation and fatigue.

Which is why airport lobbies are so disappointing. The weary traveler looks forward to them as refuges, as places of predictably expensive yet decent food, as niches for finding news, for napping, for catching up on the inevitably delayed tasks of business traveling. The airport lobby is the hoped-for oasis, the place to make phone calls, to check email, to catch up on all the forum messages posted by creative writing students.

But the chairs in airport lobbies seem deliberately shaped to obviate comfort. The meals are often stale or tasteless. The television monitors are usually tuned to the wrong stations. And the Internet access -- which costs about ten bucks an hour -- is always filtered through a proxy server which prevents the user from accessing preferred sites.

Consider the example of Toronto. I arrive four hours before my flight with the express purpose of devoting that time to forum responses. I want to make sure that I have reflected on, and made suggestions to, the sentence submissions of every student in my creative writing class. I dutifully enter my credit card number into the wifi access form, fill out the improbably large array of requested personal details, create a temporary service account, and log on. The welcome screen assures me that I can go anywhere I want online. So far so good. But, of course, I soon discover that the system prevents secure connections. The online creative writing course is, naturally, a secure (https) connection.

I recognize, with mounting anger and anxiety (in that order) that I will not be able to submit my intended responses, that I will be inert, stuck, boondoggled, as I have been so many other times, by the senseless indifference on the airport lobby. The place is a miasma of hurdles, blockages, dead ends. 

And I realize that tomorrow, when finally I make it back home, when the sundry commitments of the busiest week of the season grab hold of my energies and shake them into submission, that I will have to catch up, to explain to my students what has happened, to try to shoehorn my responses between other commitments stacked together like cordwood.

I try to relax, to go with the flow -- don't push the river, as they say. It will all work out. No worries. I settle back into the chair. But the back of the chair seems designed to dig into my shoulder, and the noise from the intercom overhead is jangly and strident, and the turkey sandwich I ate is waking up again inside my stomach. And I remember, after all, that I am in an airport lobby. And in those places, the oasis is a dry well.

                <MESSAGE> &lt;br /&gt;Hi folks;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have had a creative and interesting week. It has been fun for me to see the various posts, and especially to see the continuing trend of posting flurries on Saturday and Sunday when people finally realize they need to post something and the end of the week is drawing nigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reviewing the theme assignments over the next few days. As a group, they certainly look engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have an important due date coming up: the first assignment. It is due at the end of this coming week (Sunday, February 15). If you have already submitted the first project (I have one or two), I will send feedback this week. For everyone else, make sure to spend some time reviewing the suggestions and tips for the week, and try not to fall into the weekend-flurry habit. It's difficult to write well when you are in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions, please let me know. Otherwise: a writer writes.&lt;br /&gt;(With regard to questions, the most common one is this: how long? The answer can be found in the postings for the first week. The second common question is: what is plain text? Again, please review the first week. The answer is: files ending in .txt are plain text.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>===================
 Welcome to Week 7
===================

I must tell you how happy I am to discover a new mode for Emacs, called rst-mode, that has all kinds of nifty ways of assisting in the creation of reStructuredText documents (see week 1 if you have no idea what I'm talking about). One of the things I like most about this mode (which is available for free, online, as with everything Emacs, http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html), is that it's very smart. It knows what to do in a given situation. So, if I'm creating a headline, for example (as above), I don't have to format it in the regular reStructuredText way (by adding all those equals signs). Instead, all I have to do is this:

Here is a header
^

And by just putting that one carat on the next line, rst-mode gives me this:

==================
 Here is a header
==================

This is accomplished by the shortcut Ctrl-c Ctrl-a, in case anyone is interested (you're not, I know; but humour me for a minute). The same shortcut does auto-completion on lists, formatting of various kinds, and so on. Very cool. So, if this was a blog post (for example) and I wanted to publish it to my blog, then create a PDF, then a typeset document, then a Word file (not that anyone uses Word files...) I could do all of that with one command for each format. Very nice. One master document to rule them all...

On to assignments and course work:

You will see that the content for this week is fairly light. It's reading break for the latter half of the week, and you have just completed an important assignment (to which I will respond soon), so I wanted to give you a little break; a breather, so to speak.

In case you are interested, my Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts class is having a field trip to Science World this week (Thursday, 11:00 am). You are welcome to join us for that excursion.

Read. Write. Read some more. Write a bit more. Keep going. That's the idea.

I am editing my upcoming book at the moment, and thought I'd include a small vignette. There was some conversation last week about tenses, and in this vignette I use multiple tenses (thus violating my advice to you). Watch for the shift in tense and see if you can figure out why I wrote the passage in this way.

--

This child will awaken early, on a Tuesday morning. She will be fifteen years old. The house will be quiet, though as she dresses in the dark she will hear the sounds of someone rolling over in bed, down the hall and out of sight. The wind will come from the northwest, and will bring the scent of fir trees and salt water and mossy ground after the recent rains. She will gather her things in a small backpack -- slim wallet, blue sweater, book with a tattered spine, four slices of beef jerky, can of root beer, journal with spiral designs on the cover, bag of toiletries, white envelope with photographs inside -- and she will leave the house. She will not lock the back door. She will take the path that leads behind the house, she will cross the damp fields, and she will find the ribbon of highway that meanders beneath mountains in the east. She will not know her destination, nor what her next steps should be. She will walk at the roadside, listen for the sounds of cars approaching, gaze into the sky with its clouds scuttling across her vision. She will be entirely alone.

A car will stop. Or she will flag down a bus, or a truck. And though many people from her community travel this road, none will do so this morning, and so no one will confront her, cajole her to return, report her escape to anyone who might come after her. It will be as though her world stands aside, and with closed eyes grants her passage. And in the space of that opening, in the crispness of the wind and by virtue of her own resolve, she moves forward unchallenged. No force delays or thwarts her. But she is afraid, and tentative, and she imagines the many ways in which her boldness might bring her harm. A light rain begins to fall. The roadside dust settles. She gazes down the highway, following with her eye the wide turn of the road and its disappearance over a shallow, saddled hill in the distance. She wonders where she will spend the night.

--

Cheers.

                <SUBJECT>Welcome to Week 8</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>Hi folks;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now you should have received my feedback on your first main assignment (I sent the feedback on Tuesday and Wednesday, so unless you never check your email, you should have had it for a few days by now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everyone seems to be doing well. Much energy and passion in these narratives, and much commitment to the creative process. Well done. Good. And: notice that the items I suggested for improvement on your assignment are, for the most part, the same items as I tagged a few weeks ago when I went through your sentences and paragraphs. Here's the short list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall tightening&lt;br /&gt;Speechification&lt;br /&gt;Tenses&lt;br /&gt;Getting yourself out of the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last one can be hard to describe; but it's the difference, essentially, between Wonder Bread and stone ground whole wheat bread. The difference, in other words, between processed --filtered, sifted, hybridized -- and the real thing, which raw and chewy and undiluted by intentional improvements. If you want to see (read) what I'm talking about (and you should), pick up Chris Hedges' book &amp;quot;War is a Force that Gives us Meaning.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and while I'm thinking about assignments: I am tempted to say that if anyone uses the word &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; again I will fail them on the spot. (Tempted, sorely so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the general rhythm of the course is one student post on Monday, a smattering of posts mid-week, then a flurry on the weekend. That's fine, and it has led me into the habit of responding to all the posts in the week after they are assigned. So, I will be responding to the parables this week. I like to see a whole raft of them, to see what the general trend is, before wading in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take a look at the content posted for the coming week: creativity as therapy. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have questions or concerns (Tierney: fiction response coming soon...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Welcome to Week 9, a busy week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, please review the readings for this week. I have included various tips, reminders, and examples which should help you to start thinking about the specifics of assignment 2 -- which, indeed, is due at the end of the week. For this assignment, choose one of the genres that you have not yet explored (remembering, of course, that all genres are essentially the same...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this week includes a collaboration exercise. Check out the details at the course website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reviewing and commenting upon the creative process posts tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A writer writes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[This post was composed in Vim, not Emacs. Vim is simpler, and designed to function only as a text editor, unlike Emacs which has all kinds of extra functionality. I have written one book in Emacs, one book in Vim, one book in OpenOffice, and one book in Word. In general, Emacs is better for complex editing tasks, whereas Vim is more like a Zen-type environment. Neither OpenOffice nor Word provides a suitable environment for writing a book.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;Hi folks;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you may recall from my Monday posting, I had intended to respond to various topics yesterday (Tuesday) and to get generally up to date with what people are thinking and doing. But, as you know (and various of you are writing about), matters have a way of taking charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have seen on the Monday evening news that two men fell out of a speeding boat on the Fraser River. Although both men were rescued by the Albion Ferry, one of the men died. I have worked with the crews and operational staff of the Albion Ferry quite a bit, and I might be described as their resident counsellor. So, when these events transpired on Monday night, I was called in to assist with various psychological issues faced by the crews, staff, passengers, and public. I was at the ferry all day yesterday, and therefore did not have any opportunity to get caught up with postings for our course. Apologies for the delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be returning to the ferry to do some more counselling and consulting over the next couple of days, but for now I'm back at the office and trying to get caught up. If nothing else happens, I should be up to speed by Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's interesting (never use &amp;quot;it's&amp;quot; in good writing): I have been tossed out of a fast-moving speed boat and seriously injured (I wrote about this in one of my books) and I have rescued other people who have fallen out of boats or jumped off bridges into the water (I write about this in my upcoming book on addictions). For a writer, the question of the parallels between creative life and personal life is always an open question. I won't be able to write about this incident at the ferry, but it does make me wonder about the path of the man who died, about how my path might well have been his, and about the nature of life paths in general. These are important ruminations for the creative life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi all;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the semester progresses, time seems to speed up: deadlines loom (and pass), tasks grow in urgency, the number of hours in each day seems to decrease incrementally. This appears to be a universal principle, a kind of karmic rule, to which all are subject. I notice this in myself: more assignments come in, fewer go back out. Part of this, no doubt, is due to the fact that all of the courses I am teaching this semester are moving toward larger and more final assignments. I have more to do, and the same amount of time in which to do it. Which, according to the laws of physics, will result in friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: I'm a few days away from completing my assessments of your second assignments. I will post material for the coming week, will review your comments about the ethical dilemmas, and I will try to get caught up soon. But if I am a bit slower in responding to questions this week, you will know why. I am hard at work, reviewing and assessing, wondering why the pace of modern life seems to squeakily fast...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi all;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume you have struggled through, or are still struggling through, the exquisite suffering of creative composition. I have been telling various people that a writer must be left, at some point, to fend for themselves against the wolves of indifference. So I've been leaving you alone, for the most part, to make your way through these final turns. But we come now to the final week, in which I will review all of the final assignments and forum postings. So please make sure that you do two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Submit your final assignment (by today or tomorrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Review your forum postings and contribute more if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will check in later in the week to give you an update about final steps. For now, keep going... (Hint: the wolves like chocolate.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>i will probably watch misery again and secret window. I'm a big Stephen King fan. I have read the book Misery but have not read Secret Window so this time I might read Secret Window so I can see how I feel about the movie. I know when i read The Shinning and then watched the movie the movie was very disappointing. Misery on the other hand wasn't so disappointing so I&amp;quot;m gonna hope that secret window doesn't betray me. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Phaedra;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film Secret Window is based on one of the stories in King's Four Past Midnight. It's a good book. But there's another, similar King story, a novel called The Dark Half, which you should also check out. Then there's also the new King novel, also about writing, called Lisey's Story. It's good too (though not as good as Duma Key).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>By the way, King has said that he thinks Lisey's Story is his best book ever:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.liljas-library.com/showinterview.php?id=35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lilja: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisey’s Story&lt;/b&gt; is a very nice book. One of your best books if I may say so.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stephen King: &lt;/b&gt;I think it’s THE best book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lilja: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stephen King: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, I do. Yeah, I think it’s the best one and... you just never know. You sit down to work on a book and then when I was done with it I said to myself, “I don’t really wanna write another book because it won’t be as good”. I mean it’s like if you read a really good book, you put it on the shelf and you feel sad because you say to yourself, “I’m gonna read another book but I &lt;u&gt;know&lt;/u&gt; it won’t be as good as this one”. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lilja: &lt;/b&gt;Do you feel that when you’re done or do you feel it in the process, that this is about to be something very good?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;The US edition of Lisey's Story&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.liljas-library.com/img/other/lisey_big2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen King: &lt;/b&gt;You just feel it. You know when it’s going along day by day that it’s really, really good and you don’t know why…you just kind of like...write it and say, “boy I hope this will stick that way”. But...I never had a book quite like &lt;b&gt;Lisey&lt;/b&gt; and it was funny how that worked out because when I wrote most of it I was really sick a lot of the time. I had pneumonia and I picked up one of these hospital infections so that when I got out of the hospital I was just nauseated all the time, I couldn’t keep food down, I felt like crap. The book was just angelic... So that was good but I actually literary wrote &lt;b&gt;Lisey&lt;/b&gt; in between running to the bathroom to vomit what I had eaten last and finally I shook what ever it was I had. And the book just never really lost that magic for me and usually you write a book and you usually feel pretty good about it when you’re writing it. I usually feel like “Goddamn, this is good, this is great” and then it comes to a point when you have to work on it again and you say, “oh, what a pile of shit this was, what were you thinking?”. You know you always feel a little bit like you fell short but I never felt that way with &lt;b&gt;Lisey&lt;/b&gt;. I felt good about that book. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

Hoping to see you guys' reviews. cheers </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Hi Everyone!</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>Hi Ross and everyone in the class! &lt;br /&gt; I'm really excited to begin this class and look forward to sharing my work and reading yours over the next four months. This is my third Creative Writing class (I am also currently enrolled in CRWR 2300 with Zoe Landale). I'll be honest here...I've never taken a class in non-fiction writing. However, I am very interested in the genre and look forward to the reading material and the challenges of writing in a different style than what I'm used to!&lt;br /&gt; I've been looking over the book list and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to where to buy the majority of these books? I'm probably going to go to Chapters this evening and I hope most of them will be available to purchase. If not, I may go to the library...but I would like to purchase them if possible. I just hope that I don't have to order them in as they sometimes take several weeks. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Sarah;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the class. I hope you have fun.&lt;br /&gt;I try to give students the option of where to buy books (as the bookstore is absurdly expensive), but I have esoteric tastes, and Chapters et al are not the best places for esoteric material. So, they will have some of the books. Banyen (on 4th in Vancouver) will have more. But your best bet really is to buy online, from amazon, abe's, or wherever. This is also the cheapset method, by far, and the books will arrive within a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;Let me know what you are interested in and I will tell you where to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Re: Hi Everyone!</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> Thanks Ross. Your right, it was difficult to find many of the books at Chapters this evening. However I did happen to buy Pirsig's &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt; which looks quite fascinating. As far as the others...I was able to find many of them in Kwantlen's libraries (all campuses) and place holds. So I will take those out, read a bit from each, and then decide from there which ones I want to purchase. I'll definitely let you know which ones I'm interested in and if I need help finding them. As for other students, I would strongly suggest looking through Kwantlen's library system as they have many of the titles on Ross's book list.&lt;br /&gt;Happy searching! </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Still waiting for a few of the books I put on hold from Kwantlen's library. They're coming in from the Richmond campus so hopefully they'll be here by Monday. I'm going to read a bit from each and decide form there which ones I want to purchase. Looks like the best place to purchase is online through Amazon. Amazon has many of the titles and the paperbacks are very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;Happy hunting Caprice &amp;amp; Edmond!&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Book hunting is one of the greatest joys of literary life.&lt;br /&gt;So many secrets, so many stories.&lt;br /&gt;There's a myth about this: The lost library of Alexandria. It's the archetype of all the hidden knowledge, waiting somewhere. (See Umberto Eco, The Name of the Rose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Ross,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's the voodoo magic for opening your links in a new window? I'd love to del.icio.us these, but even opening them in a new tab opens them in the Moodle framework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hi to everyone else, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm so glad to be here -- the class was full before my registration window even opened, but, after entering the course number so often I still have it memorized, I finally got my seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;happy dance&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to playing with you all. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hey Ross,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad I managed to get a spot in your class this semester =) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had a quick question regarding due dates (I appologize if this has already been covered in a previous discussion). I know that for regular assignments, the due dates will be posted in the given section, but when are our forum postings due (such as the movie review posts)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a bunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Caprice&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> I chuckled inwardly when I saw that Agatha Christie types using three fingers, as I type with two. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I have trouble with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping a journal. When I write, I tend to write only for an audience. When I do writing of the whiny, diary sort, the &amp;quot;This is what happened today, and this is what I'm thinking about, and so-and-so is driving me nuts,&amp;quot; I drive myself nuts, but only later, after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reason, I have never finished a notebook. I write a few pages, then stop at some point because I hate something I've written. Then I start a new notebook, or restart on looseleaf paper, or look for a notebook with perforated pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tear pages out of these unfinished notebooks that I want to keep, I don't know what to do with them either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I split things up and write different types of things in different notebooks -- for a while I had a separate one for working on poetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone else do this, or am I the only neurotic one? Any ideas on why, or what to do about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: I know it's not environmentally as friendly, but I'm madly in love with the Pilot VPen, a disposable fountain pen. Just don't take them on airplanes -- they leak when the pressure changes. :)&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;I do not keep a journal. I don't think my life is that interesting...&lt;br /&gt;And I do not write stream-of-consciousness, either. I write as craft: slowly, with intention. That would not work at all for a journal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write when I want to make art, not when I want to rehash the minutiae of my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ah. I've never heard of anyone else doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Books like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Artist's Way&lt;/span&gt; insist on this kind of approach, to write even when you don't feel like writing. In fact, most books I read about writing insist that you must practice your craft all the time, without skipping days, yadda yadda. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while I had a writing partner and we did timed writings in the style of Natalie Goldberg, but it bothered me that we never did anything with them and I backed out of the arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just never seemed ok to write only when you want to create a piece, even though that's what I find myself most naturally doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>The free writing style is an artifact of Pop Psychology and the human development movement (in which, I should say, I have been a consistent participant. So, it's a writing-as-therapy approach which is found very rarely among professional writers, who approach writing as a kind of craft that is distinct from (but related to) personal psychology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the craft approach. It preserves the specialness of the art.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Now that you say that, I can't think of many things that make me feel worse than producing pages and pages of freewriting about the bad things that have happened to me and the crappy feelings I'm having. Or coming across said pages again, later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something ennobling, dignifying, and healing, however, about taking the same bad things and crappy feelings and turning them into a poem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it. . . I am never again trying to write Julia Cameron's Morning Pages. . .&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I don't keep a journal. It's hard to not become whiny and cynical writing day after day of things that don't matter. I do keep notebooks though. They organize all the stuff I do want to put into my 'for others' writing, or at least keep the ideas around until I can use them. For the pages you do want to keep, perhaps a file folder? Or scan them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore yellow paper for writing. Combined with black ink, the words popcorn off the page.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Is MS Word ALL that bad? Really?</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> I'm not quite buying the idea that Microsoft Word is a bad choice for word processing. First of all, whether or not the majority of writers using Word creates &amp;quot;a pattern of consciousness&amp;quot; whose &amp;quot;consequences are not insignificant&amp;quot; is not exactly a measurable quantity. Secondly, if all writers switched to an off-the-beaten-track text editing program such as Vim, then what would stop that same &amp;quot;pattern of consciousness&amp;quot; emerging from its over-use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like most of the argument comes down to a beef with Microsoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if somebody (like me) only used Word for its very basic functions (typing, copying, pasting, saving, etc. &amp;quot;Fiddling with fonts and margins&amp;quot; - who does &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;??)? How is that different from using the basic functions that text editors provide (aside from enabling Microsoft in its crushing world domination scheme, of course)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the comments about MS Office being a space-suck and that Word isn't always reliable in certain instances, such as uploading to the Web. Those are reasonable statements. Fact is, there isn't a problem with using Word for writing. At least, I haven't come across it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Rebecca, I totally agree. I have used Word for years and this is the first class I've ever been told NOT to use it. Even though I have read the various links Ross has posted explaining the various reasons it shouldn't be used, I still just don't get it. But, I'll give it a try...&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>When it insists on capitalizing the first letter of every line when I write a poem, I see red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It replaces straight up quotation marks with open and close quotes, even if you don't want it to. Sometimes it converts a double-hyphen to an em-dash, sometimes not, but there is no rhyme or reason. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put simply, Word does things you don't want it to, without asking. I've adapted to Word and intuitively know how to handle it to get the best out of it, but I have seen it irretrievably futz up the formatting in documents when it passes through too many systems, as is often the case at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn't work well cross-platform. We have both Macs and PCs on our desks at work, and there are certain documents we use only Word on PC for, because otherwise we know there will be problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred tool right now is Google Docs, but only because it allows me access anywhere I have an Internet connection. I can then back up my work by downloading a copy to my hard drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I still use MS Word at home and at work, but only because switching would be too disruptive to most everyone around me.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Hi Tierney,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You make some excellent points and I completely agree with you about how Word does things you don't want it to (capitalizing letters you don't want it to - exactly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If this was the premise of the argument against using Word, great, no questions asked. But from what I inferred from some of posted material is that the issue is not so much with Word itself but with everybody using Word, and it becoming the industry standard. That being said, I'm totally open to using another system for writing (even though I have used Word for years and, prior to that, good old green-on-black Ctext). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a switch, for me, would happen for practical reasons (some of which you outlined in your post) not out of fear of being sucked into &amp;quot;a pattern of consciousness&amp;quot; or for being anti-Microsoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hey guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can't you shut those annoying auto-corrections off? I've managed to stop them from underlining, capitalizing, etc. I must say, I am a terrible speller and Word just auto-corrects the misspelled word. I realize that this is obviously not helping me improve my spelling but I'm so utterly attached to it....lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I've started using notepad and it's okay, I guess. Any other programs that are free to download or relatively cheap to buy that you guys enjoy using?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot; it's just too difficult to change a ten-year habit...With each iteration of Word, I've come to familiarize myself quite well with the program&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do take the time to read the various rationales (some of which are posted in the content for this week and last week) for why using Word is not necessarily the best way to go for writers. Sure, it's fine for business communication, and it makes your text look nice on screen. But as a creative writing tool, it is not at all good. I am always surprised at how difficult it is to convince people of this. Often, the familiarity and comfort of Word are offered as reasons for its continued use; but those are precisely some of the best reasons for trying something else. Writing is not about exploring the familiar but rather experimenting with and plumbing the unfamiliar. And that is, by default, a difficult thing to do. But as a writer, if you do not change your habits you do not change your writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing is text. Plain, unvarnished text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way: if this was a course in lumberjacking, and I said that you had to use a chainsaw, you would do it. You would trust that I know what I'm talking about, and that I had good reasons for insisting that you not use the rusty handsaw that you bought at Canadian Tire. But somehow, when it comes to writing, the unconscious allegiance to Word -- paltry tool that it is -- outweighs all arguments, authorial or otherwise, and people continue to hack away at the tree with handsaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get out of the familiar. That's what writing is all about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot; I still just don't get it. But, I'll give it a try...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, good. You have to try it to get it. And you have to give it a fair shot. You will notice things in your writing -- errors -- that you would not have noticed before (in Word). This takes a bit of time, but you will see how Word (and other tolls) hide various important details from you -- not literally, but in the manner by which the presentation itself causes certain things to be mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this: write page in Word, and write a page in a plain text editor. Take about the same amount of time for each. Print them out. See which is cleaner. When you add this difference up across 100 or 200 or 300 pages, it's huge difference.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Well, it sure does seem that people have strong feelings about my suggestions about the tools of writing. I'm glad to see such a robust conversation, though the general mood of the group is surely against me on this one. I have tried, somewhat half-heartedly, to pull the authority card on Christopher in my response to him (I am a professional author! Listen to me!) but I don't think even that is going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My argument is not primarily against Word's popularity, or its intrusiveness, or its technological corruption, or with Microsoft itself. Rather, it just does not work as well as plain text editors for writing. That's the main and only important point. You have to try plain text for a while to see the many advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say this: the essence of creativity involves pushing beyond what's comfortable, known, safe, habitual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Actually, come to think of it, I used WordPerfect on a 386 when I took Creative Writing my junior year of high school (yes, I'm slightly old). White text, black screen, minimal distractions. At the bottom, there was a one-line list of commonly used key commands, but that was it. No Internet, no IM, no multitasking. I could work on my writing solidly for hours back then. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, I have the benefit of a host of reference docs at my fingertips, and I wouldn't trade those, but Ross is right about the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could just mute the husband and the barking dog, I'd be all set.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ah, I see what you mean here. I had asked if you could tell what was written in Word and what was written in a text editor (thinking there was some kind of hidden formatting clue) but it's more to do with actual writing. I'll do the recommended exercise for the comparison... </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Your suggestions about the tools of writing have definitely given me something to think about. Before this class, I had never even dreamed that the idea of using MS Word would somehow be detrimental to creative writing but you (and the other posted materials) make a good argument. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I challenged some of the ideas for the sake of conversation and I hope I didn't come across as being pig-headed. I'll try out more text editors and see what happens...&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

In Emacs I have multiple dictionaries, a thesaurus, a wikipedia and about.com lookup key (which loads a browser window inside emacs!), and many other fancies. All I have to do is move the cursor over the word I'm interested in and hit one of various keys to make this happen. Actually it's very cool, just like WP in the old days but with all the extra bells and whistles you could ever want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the WordPerfect analogy is an excellent one. That's what I'm talkin' about (Willis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Actually, the handsaw &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Word: slow, clunky, weak in features. Alternate tools (the good ones, like emacs or vim) are actually far more robust, in terms of functionality, than Word. Orders of magnitude more robust, which is part of the appeal... But these tools are deceptively simple on the surface, and that is what scares people away. The best writing tools have levels and levels of depth and complexity, which one discovers slowly, by practicing and learning the craft of writing. Emacs has something like 800 keystroke options, of which I know about 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Well, yes, Emacs is available for Windows (see the Emacs post for this week), but it's not designed to work on Windows so it does not integrate very well with the rest of the operating system. But it works. I think, for Windows, your best bet is one of the Notepad alternatives or something like Backpack (on the web). There is a super-charged Notepad for Windows, and if you google around a bit I'm sure you'll find it.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> &amp;quot;pig-headed...&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course not. It's all good conversation. And I am passionate about this topic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I'm on the topic, here are a few things I do (and like) in Emacs that could not be done in any other way (at least, not all with the same tool):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Integration of email, scheduling, organization, notes,and writing (so I can use all my textual tools in emails, for example, and I can use my schedule and notes to remind me about writing tasks, and so on). I can write, copy, paste, lookup, and find all of my data in one place. Nothing is ever more than a few keystrokes away. The only other tool I use is a browser. No opening of Word, then, Outlook, then Excel, and copying around. With Emacs, everything is right there. There is even an Emacs browser, which I use sometimes to copy text from the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Fantastic textual manipulation tools. My favorites are Control-T and Alt-T, which transpose letters and words. This is a very common need: to swap the order of letters in a word (because of a misspelling) or to swap the order of two words. I use these features dozens of times a day, and there are hundreds of features like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Navigation within a document (let me just switch to the file that has the most-often-used list, without leaving Emacs). In Emacs M stands for the Alt key:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; M-a backward-sentence (so, Alt-a moves backward by one sentence)&lt;br /&gt; M-b backward-word&lt;br /&gt; M-e forward-sentence&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;C-down&amp;gt; forward-paragraph&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;C-up&amp;gt; backward-paragraph&lt;br /&gt; M-f forward-word&lt;br /&gt; C-x o Switch windows&lt;br /&gt; C-p Previous line&lt;br /&gt; C-n Next line&lt;br /&gt; C-f Forward one character&lt;br /&gt; M-f Forward one word&lt;br /&gt; M-b Back one word&lt;br /&gt; C-a Beginning of line&lt;br /&gt; C-e End of line&lt;br /&gt; M-a Beginning of sentence&lt;br /&gt; M-e End of sentence&lt;br /&gt; M-{ Forward on paragraph&lt;br /&gt; M-} Back one paragraph&lt;br /&gt; C-x [ backward-page&lt;br /&gt; C-x ] forward-page&lt;br /&gt; M-&amp;lt; Start of file&lt;br /&gt; M-&amp;gt; End of file&lt;br /&gt; C-v Move screen forward&lt;br /&gt; M-v Move screen back&lt;br /&gt; C-l Center cursor onscreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so on. This is a short list of the possibilities. Navigation is the slowest part of writing and editing, so being able to do all this without ever touching the mouse or the scroll bar is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.uh.edu/~bgb/emacs_keys.html&quot; title=&quot;Emacs keys&quot;&gt;longer list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Fancy auto-completion of words from a dictionary, from a personal list, from a list of often-misspelled words, and so on. Alt-/ completes anything. So I can can type &amp;quot;anything&amp;quot; again just by hitting Alt, then, /, then &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; (it finds the most recent word and auto-completes incrementally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Integrated version control, so that I can keep track of every single change I have ever made to a document. Not just versions of a complete document, but every single edit going back to the very first keystroke. All right there, in case I need to look it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Invisible bookmarks within files. Outlining and hiding of parts of a document. Viewing the same file from two different places (but not loading two separate copies). Stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Editing of html documents, LaTeX documents, and so on. Any kind of file, really, with all kinds of helper tools to make it easy (like auto-matching of tags in html, and highlighting of code).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. No mouse! Ever! So, my hands stay on the keyboard and I work faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. The Emacs &amp;quot;memory&amp;quot;. It remembers which files I've opened recently, which ones I'm likely to open again soon, which places in files I've visited, which directories I tend to go to, which commands I tend to use the most -- and it offers these most-often used things up to me at the right time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. And this is perhaps number one: Emacs never, ever, ever crashes. Ever. Even a power failure can't make you lose data (because every keystroke is saved in a special file as you type and written immediately to disk before your finger leaves the key).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Ross,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering what your feelings are about 'that.' Using the extra word almost seems to make the sentence flow better but is it necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I think that Three Day Road is quite the book'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'I think Three Day Road is quite the book'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thought the reasons for writing article was really interesting. I find myself falling into a routine of making sure everything's done (as in laundry, dishes, etc.) before settling down to write. I need to try one of the suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also again, in the How to Write Good, there was a funny typo in No. 34.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Use the apostrophe in it's proper place and omit it when its not needed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>
Hi Rebecca;

All the typos and errors in the How to Write Good piece are intentional (they reflect the mistakes they describe).

About *that*: it's a tricky word that has so many uses (see below!) that it can be tough to know when it's actually necessary. In the usage you describe, I would avoid it. Try to go directly to the thing itself (Three Day Road, in the case above) without relying on the conjunctive usage of *that*.

Note that I used the word *that* twice in the first sentence of the paragraph above, in addition to the first referent usage. It's a word that tends to slip in, especially in writing that is descriptive rather than imperative. Imperative is usually better, so:

Three Day Road is a great book.

The above avoids the whole question, which is usually prudent.

Here are the various definitions:

From The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48 [gcide]:

That \That\, pron., a., conj., &amp; adv. [AS. [eth]aet, neuter nom.
   &amp; acc. sing. of the article (originally a demonstrative
   pronoun). The nom. masc. s[=e], and the nom. fem. se['o] are
   from a different root. AS. [eth]aet is akin to D. dat, G.
   das, OHG. daz, Sw. &amp; Dan. det, Icel. [thorn]at (masc. s[=a],
   fem. s[=o]), Goth. [thorn]ata (masc. sa, fem. s[=o]), Gr. ?
   (masc. ?, fem. ?), Skr. tat (for tad, masc. sas, fem. s[=a]);
   cf. L. istud that. [root]184. Cf. The, Their, They,
   Them, This, Than, Since.]
   1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually
      points out, or refers to, a person or thing previously
      mentioned, or supposed to be understood. That, as a
      demonstrative, may precede the noun to which it refers;
      as, that which he has said is true; those in the basket
      are good apples.
      [1913 Webster]

            The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the
            most celebrated princes.              --Gibbon.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and
         not merely to a word. It usually follows, but sometimes
         precedes, the sentence referred to.
         [1913 Webster]

               That be far from thee, to do after this manner,
               to slay the righteous with the wicked. --Gen.
                                                  xviii. 25.
         [1913 Webster]

               And when Moses heard that, he was content. --Lev.
                                                  x. 20.
         [1913 Webster]

               I will know your business, Harry, that I will.
                                                  --Shak.
         [1913 Webster]

   Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of
         distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic
         and French ceci, generally refers to that which is
         nearer, and that, like Latin ille and French cela, to
         that which is more remote. When they refer to foreign
         words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter,
         and that to the former.
         [1913 Webster]

               Two principles in human nature reign;
               Self-love, to urge, and Reason, to restrain;
               Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. --Pope.
         [1913 Webster]

               If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or
               that.                              --James iv.
                                                  16.
         [1913 Webster]

   2. As an adjective, that has the same demonstrative force as
      the pronoun, but is followed by a noun.
      [1913 Webster]

            It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in
            the day of judgment, than for that city. --Matt. x.
                                                  15.
      [1913 Webster]

            The woman was made whole from that hour. --Matt. ix.
                                                  22.
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the
         article the, especially in the phrases that one, that
         other, which were subsequently corrupted into th'tone,
         th'tother (now written t'other).
         [1913 Webster]

               Upon a day out riden knightes two . . .
               That one of them came home, that other not.
                                                  --Chaucer.
         [1913 Webster]

   3. As a relative pronoun, that is equivalent to who or which,
      serving to point out, and make definite, a person or thing
      spoken of, or alluded to, before, and may be either
      singular or plural.
      [1913 Webster]

            He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself
            shame.                                --Prov. ix. 7.
      [1913 Webster]

            A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline
            to the greater probabilities.         --Bp. Wilkins.
      [1913 Webster]
      [1913 Webster]

   Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional
         idea, and is not properly explanatory or restrictive,
         who or which (rarely that) is employed; as, the king
         that (or who) rules well is generally popular;
         Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the
         confidence of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases
         be avoided in the use of that (which is restrictive)
         instead of who or which, likely to be understood in a
         coordinating sense. --Bain.
         [1913 Webster] That was formerly used for that which,
         as what is now; but such use is now archaic.
         [1913 Webster]

               We speak that we do know, and testify that we
               have seen.                         --John iii.
                                                  11.
         [1913 Webster]

               That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame].
                                                  --Chaucer.
         [1913 Webster] That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be
         governed by a preposition preceding it, but may be
         governed by one at the end of the sentence which it
         commences.
         [1913 Webster]

               The ship that somebody was sailing in. --Sir W.
                                                  Scott.
         [1913 Webster] In Old English, that was often used with
         the demonstratives he, his, him, etc., and the two
         together had the force of a relative pronoun; thus,
         that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom.
         [1913 Webster]

               I saw to-day a corpse yborn to church
               That now on Monday last I saw him wirche [work].
                                                  --Chaucer.
         [1913 Webster] Formerly, that was used, where we now
         commonly use which, as a relative pronoun with the
         demonstrative pronoun that as its antecedent.
         [1913 Webster]

               That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to
               cut off, let it be cut off.        --Zech. xi. 9.
         [1913 Webster]

   4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a
      demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: 
      [1913 Webster]
      (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the
          preceding verb, or as the subject or predicate
          nominative of a verb.
          [1913 Webster]

                She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy,
                And childish error, that they are afraid.
                                                  --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

                I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to
                the contrary, can by no means hinder a thing
                from being highly credible.       --Bp. Wilkins.
          [1913 Webster]
      (b) To introduce, a reason or cause; -- equivalent to for
          that, in that, for the reason that, because.
          [1913 Webster]

                He does hear me;
                And that he does, I weep.         --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]
      (c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or
          might, and frequently preceded by so, in order, to the
          end, etc.
          [1913 Webster]

                These things I say, that ye might be saved.
                                                  --John v. 34.
          [1913 Webster]

                To the end that he may prolong his days. --Deut.
                                                  xvii. 20.
          [1913 Webster]
      (d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; --
          usually preceded by so or such, sometimes by that.
          [1913 Webster]

                The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds
                Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
                                                  --Milton.
          [1913 Webster]

                He gazed so long
                That both his eyes were dazzled.  --Tennyson.
          [1913 Webster]
      (e) To introduce a clause denoting time; -- equivalent to
          in which time, at which time, when.
          [1913 Webster]

                So wept Duessa until eventide,
                That shining lamps in Jove's high course were
                lit.                              --Spenser.
          [1913 Webster]

                Is not this the day
                That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
                                                  --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]
      (f) In an elliptical sentence to introduce a dependent

          [1913 Webster]

                that this knight and I have seen! --Shak.

                O God, that right should thus overcome might!
                                                  --Shak.
          [1913 Webster]

   Note: That was formerly added to other conjunctions or to
         adverbs to make them emphatic.
         [1913 Webster]

               To try if that our own be ours or no. --Shak.
         [1913 Webster] That is sometimes used to connect a
         clause with a preceding conjunction on which it
         depends.
         [1913 Webster]

               When he had carried Rome and that we looked
               For no less spoil than glory.      --Shak.

I'm a very private person, and the idea of broadcasting what I'm doing seems self-intrusive, but I almost get the sense you use it to get yourself in the frame of mind to do whatever it is that you're about to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enlighten us, please. :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;It's kind of like the whole debate about privacy and status updates when Facebook was first introduced. I remember quite clearly being one of those individuals who would mock the whole idea about updating an online status to reflect what he or she is &amp;quot;up to&amp;quot;... but as most of us have... I conformed *shakes head*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess Twitter is now my old Facebook... I will continue to mock it until I eventually conform.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I'm on Facebook, but I have control over who views my status updates by virtue of friending, and I'm careful about what I disclose. I have colleagues from work on there, past instructors, friends, people I went to school with a long time ago, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twitter, however, is wide open. I signed up with my full name, then thought better of it and just went to a first initial. I don't want to be that findable, mostly because I have a blog where I post poetry and other things that I prefer to be somewhat anonymous. I can be found, but you have to look in the right place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's just an introvert thing. I have my public persona and my private one, and I'm cautious about who gets into my private world. Probably plural, actually -- private worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm just curious about how Ross uses it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I definitely agree with you on the fact that it is good marketing. Whether or not you meant it in this way, I find that Facebook is a great place for instant ads via status updates. I recently sold an extra pair of Russell Peters tickets within the first 30 seconds of updating my status with an &amp;quot;ad-like&amp;quot; tag line... it's amazing the amount of attention status updates can receive... </MESSAGE>

You must sit in the discomfort, the sweet pain of not knowing that perfect word, searching for it fruitlessly, wandering, calling out for it -- days and weeks on the run, pursuing that ephemeral shape -- until the gods grant you a single, luminous moment of clarity: that word, waiting for you all the time, hidden, an emerald in the underbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is better than using a thesaurus.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> When I worked with words and deadlines, a dictionary was essential but a thesaurus was the mark of an amateur (we were all, admittedly, amateurs so when we used the thesaurus, we were very subtle about it. When we felt we had to use it, we would bury the book in our laps, hidden under the desk so nobody would see). Getting caught using a thesaurus was something you just didn't do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody once forwarded me an essay about its usage. Can't remember who wrote it but this stuck:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow&quot; class=&quot;Helvetica14&quot;&gt;By plugging in words from an external source, words that had not come together during the organic process of composition, she also destroyed the rhythm and euphony of her prose. All those words were &amp;quot;strangers&amp;quot; --they had not grown up together, so they did not fit well together.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Re: Pbbbbffftttt @ Stephen King</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>Personally, I have found that the method of sitting in the tension of unknowing has been very useful creatively. Struggling with the words creates a sort of urgency and immediacy that are destroyed when you opt for the prescribed solution. Instead of using a thesaurus, I will write a substitute word, a simple word, then keep writing. As I continue on, or later in the day, I will think about that not-quite-right word and see what I can come up with. Sometimes -- with titles, for example -- this process can take weeks or months. This is not to say that I never use a thesaurus; I do. I look at the Moby Thesaurus [1] sometimes, just to get ideas of new words, but I do not typically use it (except in emergency, for example when I have no time to percolate) to find words to use during composition.

A thesaurus is a kind of narrative falsehood, typically. Best to be honest whenever possible.

                <MESSAGE>Hi Ross,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just noticed our Assignment One was due at 11 a.m. this morning. Is this right? Most of the other deadlines for the other courses have been Sundays at 11:55 p.m. (I had the same issue with the wrong time being posted with another online course this semester but, apparently, it was a system glitch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the Sunday 11:55 p.m. the standard deadline? Or is it different for this class?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, it should say 11:55 pm.

But here's the skinny: I pay no attention to due dates and times unless you seem to be not actually doing assignments. Creativity takes time, and often is not comfortable with specific structures and deadlines. So, if you need an extra day or two, by all means take one (or two). If you need an extra week, let me know. If you need an extra month, we're probably in trouble. But you get the idea.

I thought I would avoid by taking this class, but, alas, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that's how the warrior princess defeats the ogre. . . by making him finish a parable. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Philip Roth had something interesting to say about this when he was writing his book The Plot Against America:

&quot;Don't invent it, remember it.&quot;

http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995214,00.html

That's very good advice, from a writer who knows what he is talking about. Good fiction writing is a kind of recollection. Don't imagine or create the fiction; instead, allow it to inhabit you the way a memory does, fleshing itself out, making its way in your consciousness and unconscious. Let it breathe itself into life.</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Re: Ethical Dilemmas- where to post/due date</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>Actually, the journalists are the only ones who have a code of ethics. The novelists, essayists, and nonfiction writers do not. But I created a code for myself; here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;meta content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; http-equiv=&quot;CONTENT-TYPE&quot; /&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta content=&quot;OpenOffice.org 2.4 (Linux)&quot; name=&quot;GENERATOR&quot; /&gt; &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;!-- @page { size: 21.59cm 27.94cm; margin: 2cm } P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm } --&amp;gt; &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;Ethical Principles of Ross A. Laird, writer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I remind myself to honor the creative spirit in my own life and in the lives of others. I acknowledge the fragility and resilience of that spirit, and I seek to increase its presence in everything I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I recognize that my creative work exists within an interconnected web of relationships. My own creative process is one aspect of a much larger cultural, social, familial and interpersonal network in which numerous divergent values must be honored. The quality and impact of my writing depends on my ability to navigate this network with honesty and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;A central obligation of my creativity involves my willingness to explore and refine the ethical dimensions of my work, to challenge my assumptions and biases, to expand my awareness so that it includes many other features of my internal and external world. The essence of my responsibility, therefore, is to be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I recognize that all rights are accompanied by matching obligations. In the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;context of creative writing, this means that I amplify my ethical awareness as I increase my expressiveness. When I seek readership, I make an equivalent challenge to enhancing my own integrity. As I achieve greater exposure, my ethical responsibility grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I try to balance obligations to myself, to the work, and to society. I accept the responsibility to be aware of the consequences of my work and to consider its impact. Whenever possible, I honor my own creative spirit while minimizing harm to others. When obligations to myself and to the work conflict with my obligation to minimize harm to others, I seek appropriate feedback from colleagues and peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I recognize that I am accountable for my written words in the same way that I am accountable for my speech. Therefore, I seek to be fair, honest, trustworthy and sensitive to the ethical dimensions in my writing. I recognize that writing has power, for good and for ill, and I choose to exert that power toward the common good –- as I understand it through conscious engagement with myself and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I respect the dignity and rights of others: characters, readers, subjects, and other interested parties. Whenever possible, I acquire informed consent from those who may be affected by my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I recognize that creative writing, like every profession or vocation, is founded on core competencies. Therefore, I continue my professional development and consistently strive to improve the quality of my work. I pay particular attention to the feedback I receive from others, and I balance this with my own perspectives and values. I explore new legal and ethical considerations as they arise, and I incorporate them into my ethical framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;I believe that the foundation of creativity is a joyful engagement with mystery. My ethical obligations include a sensitivity to that mystery, a nurturing of it, a resistance to its ultimate resolution. I remember that the ethics of a creative artist are the means by which mystery is ushered into the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Whenever I read a book that I really enjoy, or watch a movie that has a brilliant screenplay, I am overcome with the motivation to write. Acting on that motivation, however, is a really big challenge for me, but Adaptation is one of the only works that is so affecting that it is able to convince me to sit down and write.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt in my mind that Charlie Kaufman's story is the most well-crafted screenplays in recent memory, as it encapsulates such interesting aspects of being a human and a writer. When I have writer's block, or have the urge to write but lack the motivation, I can watch this movie as inspiration. The ability to hear what the self-referential Kaufman is thinking (by hearing his thoughts and his dictations during the writing process), we can all sympathize with the character. The real Kaufman's ability to actually adapt a book that &amp;quot;has no story&amp;quot; by retelling the difficult process he had in writing it is brilliant. But what stands out in the movie is the shift in tone (the ending) when we realize that the story within the story within the story is now being written by a Donald-esque Kaufman, as the sex, drugs violence and car chase are all elements that can be attributed to his style of writing, not Charlie's (both the real and fictitious versions). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depth and beauty of a story like this just blows me away. It gives wonderful insight into the mind of a professional writer and how the creative process is so unique to each individual (even identical twins). Obviously Donald acts as the real Charlie Kaufman's conscience who is pestering him to get his writing finished, even if he has to essentially compromise his work by creating a completely different tone, like in the last part of the story. On a deeper level than what Kaufman's screenplay presents, Adaptation is a brilliant look at dealing with creativity and writer's block, and the struggle within oneself during the writing process to create something so unique and so personal.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Kyle,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think every writer can emphasize with having writer's block and each has their own ways of dealing with it. For me, reading a few chapters of an excellent book can usually boost up my motivation and inspire me to at least write a few pages. I've never seen Adaptation but from the excellent review you gave it, I think I'll go out and rent it and see if it can give me a little inspiration too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sarah :) &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Although I watched the film &amp;quot;Becoming Jane&amp;quot; several months ago, I found it to be an interesting film about the writing process, and how the circumstances of a person's life can definetely shape their stories. I always find that Jane Austen's stories make me a little irritated because of the similarity of all the endings (heroines marry for love, but also get money in the process), although for her time I'm sure that the concept of marrying for love was an intriguing one. &amp;quot;Becoming Jane&amp;quot; was interesting in that it provided a few reasons why her stories always end the way that they do, although I'm not sure if the details of the film are based in fact. The film provided some revelation for me about the struggles that she must have faced when writing in her time period, but was overall an encouraging film about the writing process and the struggles that some writers manage to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secret Window was an...odd film. I found that it provided, again, an interesting perspective on the writing process and how the circumstances of an author's life shape their stories, but the most fascinating element of the screenplay was how the author's life eventually followed the plot of one of his stories. Although the film did focus extensively on the creative writing process, I thought that it focused more on a sort of psychoanalysis of the mind of a severely troubled and warped personality. Altogether, I did not enjoy this film too much, especially since the ending was just gross. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I would have to agree Gillian. First of all, the ending was indeed gross, but as a piece of writing itself, it is amazing because it stays with you for a while afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're right when you say that it explores the creative writing process very well. But I find that it also explores some of the challenges facing creative writing. Such as suggestions of plagarism, personal problems and even writers block.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Gillian,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fan of Jane Austen's writing, I too have been slightly irritated myself about the similarity of her novel endings. However, I think that it's important to remember that--back in her time, much of a woman's life revolved around marriage and the privileges that came along with it. Back then, you were extremely lucky if you were able to marry for love. Most married a man for either social status, money, or a combination of both. Austen was the type of writer who enjoyed writing happy endings because many women didn't get the same opportunity as many of her character's did. The ending of Becoming Jane actually made me slightly sad that she did not get to marry her true love and for me, I think I would have liked to see her truly happy. I've never actually read a biography of Jane Austen, but from the little tid bits I've learned about her life here and there, I think that certain things in the movie were not quite accurate but were added in to make they story slightly more interesting. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I agree with you, Sarah, I think that Jane Austen did write happy endings in a time period when women rarely experienced such things in real life. Her novels are timeless in some senses - she is an extremely witty writer, which always makes her work amusing, and  the situations that she describes and the problems that she tries to tackle are timeless - the problems of falling in love, of securing one's future, etc. I tend to be more captivated by works of the Bronte sisters, however, which might partly explain my response to Becoming Jane. Also, I think that the movie would have been better if it hadn't been so fictionalized - it strikes me that a large component of the film was &amp;quot;made up&amp;quot; just to heighten the drama of the film. I would really enjoy seeing a film or reading a book which accurately describes Jane Austen's real life.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I thought I would do my posting on this topic rather than creating a whole new one; nonetheless I did my review on Secret Window as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically speaking, most book-turned-films tend to flop if the movie-goer has read the book prior to watching the film. Generally speaking the most common complaint is that the film rushed too many of the details that the author originally captured in print (this was one of the biggest complaints that most &amp;quot;Twilight&amp;quot; fans had about the recent release of the film). Despite this fact, I actually enjoyed Secret Window and found that a lot of the details portrayed in the book managed to work it's way into film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not too sure I agree with you (Gillian) on the ending of &amp;quot;Secret Window&amp;quot;. For a horror/mystery film, I thought the ending could have been a lot more gruesome and disturbing; but the directors and producers managed to play off a lot of the foreshadowing that was evident during the first half of the film which I thought was quite cleaver on their part. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I guess just the thought of eating something that could partially have assisted in decomposing a human being...is well, a troublesome thought - or perhaps I'm scarred from seeing Soylent Green. I think its really more a question of personal taste; I tend not to be a big fan of horror movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is off-topic, I found that the Twilight movie actually was a very good adaptation of the book. I am not a huge fan of Twilight, but since I missed the Harry Potter boat, I thought I should read the Twilight books to see what everyone was talking about. As far as I understand, Stephenie Meyer worked very closely with the film producers to make sure that the film generally followed the plot of the book. As for the dialogue, portions of it were directly quoted from the novel. Although no film can ever capture the nuances of a book, all of the important details were in place in the Twilight movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I think one of the main reasons that people dislike books-turned-movies is that when you read a book, you have a page in your hand that you can read over and over again. Details that might not be important to the plot of the novel/story can become largely important to the reader, whereas in a film, the pace of the story drives the viewer and shapes their emotions accordingly. A book is much more personal, whereas a movie is almost a manipulation of emotions due to the combination of various effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I too found Becomming Jane to be an interesting look at the writing process. I have a hard time reading Austens novels because like Gillian said, they seem to be almost repetitive with their endings. But this film explained why they end up as they do. I think this film really shows how circumstances  drastically influence peoples' writings. I think it's interesting how her own life could very well be a typical Jane Austen Novel...&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Before this class, I had not seen ‘Secret Window’ so when it came time to pick a film to view, the name of the film really appealed to me, and I immediately sensed that it would be a mystery/thriller story. The novel, originally written by Stephen King, and the film directed and written by David Koepp has now become one of my favorites because it is so captivating. My only concern with the film is that it was a little bit gory for my liking, especially the ending. In the words of Gillian and Chantelle it was just simply ‘gross’. I also found that the story presented a lot of problems that many writers do face as Chantelle had mentioned such as writer’s block and plagiarism. ‘Secret Window’ kept me guessing what was going to happen next and it was very unpredictable, especially the ending. Even though the film was supposed to be a psychological thriller, I enjoyed the various bits of humor incorporated into the film. It made it seem like there was something for everyone in this film. I was fascinated by Johnny Depp’s performance and how he managed to keep the viewer intrigued in the scenes where he was the lone character. Overall, I enjoyed this film, and would definitely watch it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Personally I don't know if Johnny Depp was thinking of Jack Nicholas in the Shinning. I think Depp just knows how to be crazy for example is version of Willy Wonka was just nuts and now that I think of that I almost think some of his Secret Window character was in his Willy Wonka character (especially how he talks to himself in both movies). That's definately a tough call. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Interesting...in a lot of Johnny Depp movies where his character is quite memorable (like the infamous Pirates movies, Willy Wonka, Secret Window, etc.) he talks to himself and pulls off a delusional, crazy sort of person. I think that Johnny Depp does &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; best in a lot of roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has done serious roles, like in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and in Chocolat, but the roles that he is best known for are his crazier ones. Perhaps every actor has a certain type of character that best suits them. I think that mentally deranged characters probably suit Johnny Depp the best. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

Nor have I seen any film with Johnny Depp in it other than the “Secret Window”, so I don’t really have anything to compare his character to. Perhaps I will find some time to watch “The Shining” and then try to see if Depp is imitating Jack Nicholson in some way, shape or form.

                <MESSAGE>I have never attempted to write a novel or short story of any sort.  After watching the secret window, it is very evident to me the struggles that writers go through in trying to write their masterpieces.  In this case, it is only after Mort, through Shooter,a fragment of Mort's imagination, committs some serious crimes, that Mort is able to begin writing again.  I also found it interesting that in order to try to get rid of his writer's block, Mort retreats&lt;br /&gt;to an isolated cabin where he will have no distractions.  I think for most people, distractions are the largest writer's block you can have.  It is only&lt;br /&gt;when you become isolated and are able to solely focus on the task at hand, that your writing can be accomplished. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Chantelle;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isolation cuts both ways. Sure, there are no distractions (or fewer, anyway), but one is also rendered more vulnerable to whatever is lurking inside the self. So, isolation is risky as well as liberating. There are a great many examples of writers who wandered off into the wilderness and never came back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I find that in my writing, isolation helps only when I actually sit down to write or type the story itself. The best things that I have ever written begin as an idea - usually just a very small seed of an idea. It is through my interactions with people and by moving through a very crowded world filled with all sorts of strange images and ideas that my story begins to take shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if anyone else writes like this, but I'm always on the hunt for a good story. Things that my hairdresser tells me, or stories I hear from different people that I meet can often spark an idea that grows. I feel that the stories I tell are usually triggered by things that happen in real life, which is perhaps why isolation wouldn't work for me unless I was trying to write some deeply reflective sort of biography.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Secret Window is Stephen Kings way of writing through his problems while he is writing. So many of Stephen King's books are based on a writer and the struggles he has. Secret Window is just one of many of his stories that allows people to understand his life without writing a boring old bibliography. Through the creative process Stephen King can open the doors to morbid and obscure worlds that enable him not only to feed his viewers taste for mystery but also soothe his need to continue writing by writing through his struggles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not totally in love with this movie-- it's by far not one of my favorites. However it holds a lot of potential creatively and makes the viewer think. This movie some what reminded me of Fight Club with the double personalities going on. I believe a movie like Fight Club was more successful than the movie Secret Window as a movie because Secret Window was a slower movie whereas Fight Club was very intense from the beginning. Secret Window in my opinion seems like it was meant to be read and felt and not seen visually. For the most part when a movie was originally a book and then a movie I always feel more satisfied with the book and angry at the movie. I have not yet read Secret Window but i plan on doing so once I've ordered it. Once I have read the book I will let you know if the movie made me feel the way the book did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read many Stephen King books he is one of my favorite writers. For anyone that is interested Misery was a fantastic book (quite gory if you don't like that thing then this isn't your book) and the movie was actually not so bad except for a few things getting changed but I enjoyed the movie. The Shinning was a really good twisted book but a lousy movie the end was all wrong I could not even finish it. The best in my opinion for books becoming movies was Stephen King's Green Mile. This was an amazing movie and book I was not disappointed by either. Oh ya IT was not too bad of a movie kind of corny but in my opinion it was the scariest one to read of Stephen kings (one of my favorites if I want a good scare).&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Phaedra;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think makes a book &amp;quot;movie-able&amp;quot;? Is it a narrative that is quite visual, or something else? Why do some books make good movies and others completely tank? The film maker plays a role, surely, but the book must be adaptable. I wonder what makes that adaptation more likely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I have no answers to this question right now. I think potentially it has to do with what I was talking about how the reader visualizes the story when they read it and how the movie director portrays the book. Maybe some people see where the director is going and had the same thoughts while reading and liked both the movie and the book. But then the people that saw the book differently in there head might not have adapted as well to the directors vision. Also I think it also has to do with how much the movie sticks with the book. Like I mentioned The Shinning movie changed the ending up which was it's biggest mistake. And for the movie IT is saw the characters looking totally different in my which put me off of the movie because the characters weren't what I wanted out of them. I actually spent all Christmas reading the Twilight saga and was about to watch the movie but from first glance the characters didn't appeal to my image of them while reading the books. Therefor I have slightly been turned off of trying to watch the movie because I enjoyed the books ( actually couldn't put them down) and don't want the movie to spoil what I liked so much in the books. I will probably wait until the book isn't so fresh in my head and maybe then I can except the movie. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Well,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I noticed that 90% of the class grabbed &lt;em&gt;Secret Window&lt;/em&gt; as their choice film to write a response to.  I also notice that the general consensus is not so good.  I, sheerly by nature, must disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I feel that this film has alot of potential if one looks past the generalization that a story made into a movie is always bad.  I think alot of people do not take into consideration the huge difference between making a film and writing a story.  For example when writing it is important to show rather than tell(As Ross likes to remind us).  In writing we as the readers are allowed free space to imagine what everything and everyone looks like.  Stories are made, generally, so that we can think and have freedom within the confines of the tale.  However in film the director is forced to make all of these decisions for us and usually we are resistant to the idea of being told what a character looks like if we already have our own image in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     Having said that I feel that this film, when judged as a film, follows all of the important rules that a good film should follow.  There is good character development (specifically in Johnny Depp's character) and we can-- to some degree-- relate to him.  The plot is set clearly and we can understand the fearful situation that the protagonist has gotten into.  There is the moment of despair when the plot twists and the character is forced to either 'face his demons', so to speak, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The whole purpose of my response is to talk about that twist at the end where Mort Rainey realizes he is Shooter and that he has murdered everyone.  It all becomes clear to him, but what he realizes differs from what we realize-- I argue.  We see that he is the murderer and so the logical course of action would be to turn himself in!  But Mort concludes that the more important issue at hand is the ending of his story.  He sees that all along he was telling himself that his ending needed to be made right and by keeping it wrong he was &amp;quot;stealing the story&amp;quot; from himself.  For the writer, the story is infinitely more important than anything else and in this case that includes human life.  The ending, after all, is the most important part of a story.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I did not feel that Secret Window was extremely horrible I love Johnny Depp and find that he portrays his roles very well. My opinion of books becoming movies and not succeeding in accordance to the book is because a book does show so much more and when it becomes a movie I find that use lose so much of what the book had. Secret Window is a good movie as a movie. I also find that when I read a book I develop what the characters and setting look like and if I see the movie made of the book and the characters and setting are not like I imagined this also ruins the movie for me. I usually like the picture I have created in my head more than what the movies give me which is also why I believe books to movies fail because we are now seeing the book from someone elses view rather than the one you created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Dave;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, it is interesting that most people chose Secret Window. It is not (by far) the best film on the list. But it's bound to be at most video stores, I suppose, and that may be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Shooter&amp;quot; appears in a different form in King's new book Lisey's Story. Instead of being called Shooter, the crazy alter-ego is from a place called Shooter's Knob. So, there's King playing with the shadow again, reminding readers that wherever you go, the shadow follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: when you say that the ending is the most important part of the story, are you talking about Secret Window or stories in general?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I agree with Melissa in that when you are adapting a book to a sceenplay details are lost and sometimes we see that as a weakness in the movie. However, it is inevitable as you are trying to fit a couple hundred paged book into a two hour movie.  Its not possible to create every detail that was mentioned in the book.  </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky (2006)</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>The Fountain is a movie that is partly related to God (Bible) and partly related to Buddhism (Zen) as the background for it. During the whole course, the director separate out human's mind and reality into two prospective. Darren try to bring out the theme of the whole storyline by third person omniscient. This is a tale told from the point of view of a storyteller who plays no part in the story but knows all the facts, including the characters' thoughts. That way the audience can experience the struggle in the main character about the desire of &amp;quot;forever living&amp;quot; method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way how the movie was set up. It basically insist that from ancient time til nowadays, people are trying their best to live as long as they can in the world. They are scare of death and sickness. Human can get so selfish about survival and wants. On the other hand, the story is telling people to &amp;quot;let go&amp;quot; at some point and time. The true happiness and relief is may not be achieving some personal goal but may be something simple like &amp;quot;letting go&amp;quot;. This philosophy is being introduced in some Buddhism studies. I remember there is a theory about human wants and needs may sometimes is just human's unlimited desire of things. Since there are nothing is forever other than the spirit itself, people should learn how to &amp;quot;let go&amp;quot; of things and consider what is really the wants and needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the example that the movie used is just an extreme one. In our daily life, there are so many things that we may not realize that we are stuck or turned into a dead end. For example, I used to compare myself with my friends on school grades. I would get so stressed when I have to write a test or exam. My desire of getting a good grade turn into unnecessary stress and worries. My grade turns out is not as good as I expected. Later, I tried not to compare with other people, but focus on doing my own studies. I ended up getting better result than before. So being said that &amp;quot;letting go&amp;quot; sometimes may not necessary means losing something, but sometimes you gain more than what you are expected.&lt;br /&gt;

                <MESSAGE>Huh. . . looks interesting. From what I gather, the movie also draws on Mayan mythology, as it references Xibalba, the Mayan underworld. As a child, I was obsessed with the Maya. I think I need to find this movie. :) Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>That's i think it's the part when he go up to the top of the temple and meet the guard for the fountain tree. That part of the movie is related to Maya mythology. The movie is very good and it got a very high rating at IMDB.com. I think it is strongly recommended. I think it is a good idea to check your local video store and see if they have it in stock before you go there. Since when I go to the Rogers close to my place, the blu-ray version is gone and they only have one Dvd version in the library.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Edmond;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad you enjoyed the movie. It sounds like it made you think about various things. Do you think that the Tom in the last part (the Tom who is in space, heading toward the nebula) is the same Tom who is the doctor? And is he the same Tom (maybe through reincarnation) who is the conquistador? It's a twisting and turning film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hey Ross&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my thinking, it is a reflection of different thinking and state in Tom's mind. It can all happen in Tom in the present. The fountain story book and other factor can affect him in his point of view toward the death of his lover. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I just watched it. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the temporal mix, the movie reminds me of Cortazar's &amp;quot;La Noche Boca Arriba,&amp;quot; which you can read in English here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.birmingham.k12.mi.us/NR/rdonlyres/A0644D2D-E656-474C-858E-1F84046B4671/0/TheNightFaceUp.pdf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xibolba itself is reminiscent of the Eagle and its emanations as described in the books of Carlos Castaneda and friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the repetition of the pattern on the floor, and of the lamps/torches receding down the many hallways in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Wow. What an odd and creepy movie... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie centers around two main characters, Paul; a romance novelist and Annie; an extremely (I think that word is an understatement in this case) obsessive, psycho fan. Paul crashes his mustang in the middle of nowhere and Annie rescues him and &amp;quot;nurses&amp;quot; (I've put this words in quotations because part of it's true and part of it is not-watch the movie and you'll know what I mean) him back to health. She turns out to be a complete psycho who abuses him mentally and physically (the scene where she breaks his ankles is utterly disturbing). She forces him to basically live at her house and makes him write a new installment of his series (Misery is the name of the character in Paul's series of books and she finds out that Paul has ended her life in the final installment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've never actually read any of Steven King's novels. I've watched a few of his movie's but never really had a great desire to read the books. This movie was interesting because the main character Paul was literally writing to save his life. To make matters worse, if Annie didn't like what he wrote she became deeply angry and would either freak right out or abuse him physically in some awful, creepy way. He was under enormous pressure to write well and write the way she wanted the book to be written. I've definitely never been in THAT sort of situation but I'm sure that all of us can relate to writing under pressure, especially when there's a due date looming over our heads. Like Paul, we are under a considerable amount of pressure to not only produce material but also to conform to a set of standards someone else has (like our Professors, etc). I can't say that I particularly enjoyed this movie but it was definitely different and it did make me think about the stress and demands that come along with writing.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Sarah;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad the movie struck a chord. I sometimes wonder about how much more productive I might be as a writer if I were imprisoned indefinitely. I'm not hoping to find out, but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>This movie is definiately morbid but the book is so much worse (don't get me wrong I liked the movie almost as much as the book in this circumstance). All those scenes where she tortures Paul are excalated ten times more in the book and I believe ( it's been a while since I've read the book) that the movie actually takes the violence down a couple notches. You really should read the book if you can handle gore because when you read a novel like this by Stephen King and how detailed and elaborate the situation is for Paul you almost wonder if Stephen King himself actually went through this it's so intense. However, stay away from his stuff if your stomach can't handle gore. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I never had my ankles broken, but the most controlling influence over my writing was my father. I like English profs -- I'd take one over him any day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was writing my college application essays, he forced the edits he wanted, then showed the essays to other people and came home triumphant when they particularly liked a sentence he'd inserted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curiously, he'd left me alone during my high school creative writing class and never so much as looked at an assignment, but forced me to let him read my poems in the literary magazine when they were published. I had a hard time writing for a long time after that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else had a similar bad writing experience, either from an instructor or someone else?&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ouch. A sure way to demean and stifle your creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (she's in grade 10) just completed her submission for the Commonwealth essay. She showed her draft to me, and although I made some suggestions (most of which she did not use) I tried very hard not to overly shape her process. It can be tough -- but if you don't step back, as a parent, and let the child develop their own voice, really really bad things happen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You asked about &amp;quot;bad writing experiences.&amp;quot; I was once accused of plagiarism. The course was History 120. I wrote an essay about -- gosh, I don't even remember. But the instructor would not return my essay, and after being fobbed off several times I finally forced the issue and was told that my paper was being held back because they knew I had plagiarized it and were looking for proof. This was in about 1982, so finding proof meant looking in books or collections of articles. But there was no proof, of course, because I had not plagiarized. But the kicker was that I was told all this about five minutes before the final exam for the course. I did not continue in History (at least, academically, though I did write a historical book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But your experience beats mine by a long shot.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I guess on the upside, your writing was so good your prof thought it must have come from a historian, instead of a History 120 student. :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you manage to come out in roughly one piece on the other side of having your voice stifled, you value voice that much more, and learn to protect it, and learn to protect other people's. If I hadn't had the childhood I did, I might have been an accountant, instead of writing and working on a psych degree. ;) I think Nietszche said something about that, somewhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some interesting essays on voice (in a psychological sense more than a writing sense) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voicelessness.com/essay.html&quot; title=&quot;Voicelessness and Emotional Survival&quot;&gt;http://www.voicelessness.com/essay.html&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>While I’m not a one bit of of a Stephen King fan, I thought Misery was fantastically creepy. Kathy Bates’ performance was outstanding as the cheery, psychotic Number One Fan – and that is from a memory of when the movie first came out.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen only one other King adaptation (Pet Cemetery) and while guys I knew would give me copies of their Stephen King books with glowing reviews, I was never much interested as I didn’t care much for the subject material and I find his writing to be bland. I suppose King deserves his spot on the literary shelves for producing so many best-sellers. Goes to show that formula can sometimes go a long way...&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ross,&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It's really nice to hear of a father actually letting their own daughter develop their own unique voice in writing. Like Tierney's father, my father always wanted to read everything I wrote in high school and always wanted to have a say in the way it was written or the editing process. It always had to measure up to some sort of standard he had even though he himself barely even finished high school. I think parents always want the best for their children (better than they had or did), and they are always trying to push us to try and do better. This is good and bad. In some sense it helps us to strive to do our best and in other ways it can be extremely detrimental to our self-confidence. My father wasn't as critical as Tierney's father, but sometimes I felt he was my biggest critic and in many ways hindered me from developing my own writing skills. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I chose Wonder Boys, without realizing that I had seen it before.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The movie made me think of how tenuous our hold on writing is; each time I produce a decent piece, I'm not sure I can do it again. Throughout my writing history, there are significant gaps, there are times when I haven't written at all, or times when I try and the work just doesn't work.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The movie also portrays literary culture, and I am acutely aware of how much I don't fit into that and don't want to. I can't stand intellectuals like Walter who have books with titles nobody understands. One of the things I've learned over the years is that it's not the length of the words that counts, it's what you do with them. And you can do some very sophisticated things with simple words. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And of course the movie begins with some brutal, almost caricaturish critique. What's brutal about it is that it really has nothing to do with the work itself -- &amp;quot;I hated it. It made me want to kill myself,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Jesus, what is it with you Catholics?&amp;quot; I think learning to handle critique, which partly means learning to ignore comments that aren't helpful or are overly cruel, is an important skill for a writer.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; What I didn't like about the movie was all the crazy antics that happened around the central point of making choices and having direction in your writing and your life. I'm not much for movies and TV shows that have people in situations that, throughout the show, make you wince on their behalf. But I like horror even less, so I was happy with my choice. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>What irks me about so many writing groups and training groups is that the people who are doing the critiquing are almost always not in a position to offer useful criticism. They are biased, or inexperienced, or whatever. Besides, most of one's response to a text is unconscious, and conscious rationalizations for reacting a certain way are added in by the reader as explanations for a given reaction. But the reaction is instinctive, beyond reason or intellect, and as such, intellectual explanations for a response to a text are never authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Brilliant. Thank-you so much for basing this course on one-on-one (student and instructor) critique. I find that many other courses are structured around students being forced to evaluate fellow students’ work. Which I found to be completely and utterly useless (with no offence to anybody here I’ve taken a class with before, of course). </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;I liked the ending of Secret Window. My only difficulty was that corn wouldn't help decompose the bodies as quickly as say, tomatoes or azaleas. Now I'm going to sit up all night wondering what combination of plants would do the best job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;I did like the tie to the short story, how Mort was evolving into Todd Downey. Did anyone else see the salt, Morton's Salt, in the grocery scene after the murders? It was suggestive that perhaps Morton himself was a fictious character, along with Shooter and Todd. The writer blending into his creations, until there remains only the character. The voice over consciousness that kept poking and poking at the holes in Mort's memory felt very authorial. I do that all the time, big doormouse holes in my stories. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;The use of mirrors was great. How the movie opened by going through the mirror, while a little detail, did set me up for 'something's not right, why the mirrors' paranoia in the first ten minutes. I could've had a drinking game for each time there's a person in the mirror that is untrue. The magritte reference was neat too- Bowler hats and back of heads. All the little details, ever insignificant it seems, are important to the story. They work better than an info dump, like a tumbler falling into place after long hours of precise work. Less painful than a shovel to the face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: georgia,times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;I wonder if the shovel-in-the-face guy would've broken his nose, or a cheek/occipital bone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy it when a narrative plays with the question of who is real. It's the old butterfly question of Chuang Tzu, one of the oldest narrative devices of all. Philip K. Dick's Ubik was voted one of the most important books of the 20th century (by Time magazine) for the way Dick explores this theme. His book The Man in the High Castle does the same thing, as do many of his other books (the VALIS series, in particular). In fact, many of the modern narratives from other writers have been inspired by the way in which PKD played with reality and identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, a shovel to the face would likely break the occipital bone as well as the cartilage of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> I wasn’t sure if we were supposed to watch a movie we hadn’t already seen before or not but I was in the mood to re-watch Adaptation. Basically, the movie is a multi-layered movie within a movie based on screenwriter Charlie Kauffman who is obsessed about his weight, his hair, women, and doing justice to Susan Orlean’s novel, The Orchid Thief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is so tied up about representing the book in its true form that he doesn’t get much accomplished in the way of writing the screenplay, perhaps because nothing much happens in the actual book “It’s all about flowers,” said Kauffman. So then the movie twists into a movie with all the elements of Hollywood - car chases, sex, drugs and drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the book was great and it took some real imagination and risk-taking on the part of the screenwriters to take it and shape it into something palatable for the multi-plex crowd. Each time I watch it, it does take some forced departure of reality as I am a fan of Orlean’s writing and the idea of her doing blow and having sex with her subjects is disturbing to the point of distracting. While Meryl Streep's character falls further and further away from Orlean's during the story, she does an excellent and entertaining job of being an unhinged wild woman in the second half of the film. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I agree with Rebecca.  It is very true that writers have a difficult job when trying to adapt a book into a screenplay.  Not only do the writers have to worry about producing a great movie, but also not straying too far from the plot of the book.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Wonder Boys was an excellent film depicting the struggles a writer may face and what kinds of influences your surroundings may have on your work.&lt;br /&gt;I think all writers have been in the same predicament as Grady, where they’re unable to write anything of any substance and so continue to write in hopes that it’ll appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grady wouldn’t admit to writer’s block, and I’m unsure if what he was experiencing would count as that. His life was in a rut, and his writing mirrored that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finally took the simple curiosity of “Vernon” and his girlfriend to make Grady realize that he had been writing simply for the sake of writing. &lt;br /&gt;Without purpose or direction, Grady was lost and tried to remedy that by continuing to write. Because of that, he was unable to make any choices in regards to his story and would have never come to a conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also loved the eccentric characters portrayed by Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr. as it was a nice representation that most writers are a little bit crazy (or sane?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Christopher;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About craziness: on aggregate, the rates of mental illness are highest among artists. Among artists they are highest among writers, and among writers they are highest among poets. So yes, craziness exists in higher proportion in the writing population. But the question remains: does writing make you crazier than the average person, or do people with &amp;quot;crazy&amp;quot; tendencies (the counsellor part of me shudders at this terminology, but the writer part is unfazed by it...) tend to be drawn to writing? The evidence is for the latter, thankfully. Writers tend to exist in what Lewis Hyde calls the realm of the trickster (see his book Trickster Makes this World). Such a realm is one in which people tend to question authority, are uncomfortable with structure, and like to do things their own way. It's an entire personality set that tends to set people apart somewhat. Childhood trauma helps this happen, so in many ways it's good for writers to have had a tough childhood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And, by the way, I take no position on the downloading of torrents).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5pt 0cm; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;I remember seeing this movie in the theatre a long time ago, but I had totally forgotten about it. I was pretty excited to see it on the list and took the time to rewatch it.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I think the film is rather typical in that it is the same story we have seen many times before of a lost boy searching for a father figure, or even of two lost souls finding comfort and ultimate answers in each other. The inclusion of Claire Spence also emphasizes this mainstream tendency of film as she seems to be another stereotypical inclusion in the story line. I posted about the film Becoming Jane as well, and this movie frustrated me in the same way that that film does, in that they include some typical love story to make it appeal to the masses. That said, I still very much enjoyed Finding Forrester. It is an easy to watch film that really allows a viewer to connect with its characters.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I think character depth is often lacking in film.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The writing aspect of the story really helped develop the characters.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;The world of the fictional writer, William Forrester, who gave up writing, is so interesting and it intrigued me how it took another 'lost' person to make him embrace his gift again. The film dives into the separate lives of two characters but its heart is in its portrayal of their relationship with one another.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The connection between the two characters is evident. They both seem to be living lives that do not fully represent their potential. Forrester as a literary genious living as a recluse and Jamal as a great writing talent and extremely educated young man living for his friends and not for himself, both seem to be trapped by their living situations.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They are connected in that they both seem to truly exist through their writing abilities. 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He becomes a complete recluse, not even able to leave his apartment for simple grocery shopping.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When Jamal enters his life he is forced to revisit his writing and it is in this that he begins to open himself up to the real world once again.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;By the end of the film he seems to have gained some new form of enlightenment, undoubtedly caused by Jamal's pressure to force him to write again, and therefore branches away from his apartment. When he leaves, Jamal says &amp;quot;don't forget to write&amp;quot; a goodbye with a double meaning.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He wants him to stay in touch, but he also wants him to continue to write as he realizes that writing is a huge part of Forrester's life and without it, he seems to have nothing.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;The most important line of the film, in my opinion of course, is when Forrester says to Jamal &amp;quot;a lot of writers know the rules about writing, but they don't know how to write.&amp;quot; I think this really emphasizes the whole meaning of the film that literary genious extends far past memorization.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Anyone can memorize a few lines of extraordinary writing and regurgitate them to others; this point is further emphasized when Jamal challenges his teacher in class, only to be shot down. 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;In conclusion, I really enjoyed this film.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I think it is a great introduction to a writer’s mindset and ultimately into the importance of creativity in one’s life, for without it, things seem to merely stagnate.

                <MESSAGE>Hi Amanda;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad you enjoyed the film (despite its predictable Hollywood-ish elements), and I'm going to try to pretend that it does not look like you wrote your forum response in Word...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;a lot of writers know the rules about writing, but they don't know how to write.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I find that many writers do not know some very basic things about how to write; they use editors and copy-editors for all sorts of things that writers should be doing themselves. But the general principle seems to be true; writing is craft, and not simply a mechanical procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Barton Fink made me feel like hell, but that’s why it was so amazing. Like most Coen Brothers films it’s dark and even nightmarish at times. The story is about a 1940’s playwright (John Turtorro) who leaves New York for Los Angeles, in order to work in Hollywood as a screenwriter. From the very beginning it’s obvious that Fink has made a huge mistake and he begins to unravel mentally like the shoddy wallpaper that keeps falling in his decrepit apartment. Throughout most of the movie he also suffers from writers block, which is as unnerving as the apparent murder that he becomes involved in. It’s clear that he’s starting to go a bit crazy near the end because of his writing, but it was hard for me to tell what was real and what wasn’t. I just watched Synecdoche, New York and they were a lot alike for this reason. They both had scenes with burning buildings as well and neither of them were literal fires, which is a weird coincidence. I haven’t pinned down the meaning of the fire in Barton Fink yet. Perhaps it’s representing the fires of hell, the destruction of his fantasy world or maybe it’s just representing the pressure he’s feeling. Aside from all of that, the dialogue was impeccable and the cinematography was great. I loved the underlying criticism of Hollywood as well. It made me think about the cost of my integrity and the frustrations of being a writer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;Yup, great movie. Very provoking of discomfort. I liked the wallpaper scene. Every time my wife and I check in to a hotel that is a bit old or tattered, we call it the Barton Fink Motel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I watched Misery again, I keep forgetting how good this movie actually is. When I watch more recent movies I find that they are always chock full of special effects. And the more real acting of two people on screen interacting just with each other is almost a lost are now. Kathy Bates scares the living crap out of me, but somehow she reminds me or Roseanne, maybe this is just me. James Caan also play his role to a T. In some weird way everytime I watch Misery, and I see the interaction between Bates and Caan, I keep going back to the scene in The Graduate, with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, where it's just the two of them and she seduces him in nothing but a slip that to me is another example of two actors doing what they do best and just acting with not high budget special effects to support them. </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>My Walk</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>I just came back from a walk through my Newton neighbourhood. I put in earplugs to drown out the sounds that could distract me. I read the links and made a mental note of a few tips as I set out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stepped out of my front door, the cold hit me. I told myself to clear my mind of any thoughts and concentrate on the walking. I don't even recall if I could see my breath as I walked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staring down at the road, I concentrated on a spot about six feet in front of me. I paid attention to the cracks and crevasses that were but two steps away. Under the street light, the wet asphalt looks like a dark sky with the intermittent twinkle of a field of stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no concept of how long I had been walking. I only looked up occasionally from the road, so apart from the conscious bends of the street, I had no concept of where exactly I was. And it was strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my hardest to block out my thinking and focus on my senses, absorbing the world around me. It was the first time I ever noticed the smell of fresh air. At one point on my walk an unfamiliar scent hit me strong and I knew someone was nearby. They smelled like Christmas: pine tree and cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body has a natural and unmistakable rhythm to it. With every step I took, I heard the sole of my shoe hit the pavement, the sound of my sleeve scrape against my jacket, the sound of the in-time inhales and exhales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got back home (it's really hard to walk without a destination because I know that ultimately I'd have to return home), I stood motionless on my driveway for about a minute. I concentrated on the sound of my heart beating; slow, and pulsating through my ears. I could smell nothing but air. I could hear the faint sound of water drops hitting the gutter. When I took out my earplugs, only then did I realize that it was raining. I oriented my senses once again, and I was hit with a rush of cold. My hair was wet, my face was wet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long it was raining. I have no idea when it started or where I was when it happened, but it was a strange feeling. I was able to block out an entire sensation of touch, as I focused so heavily on the sounds and smells of the world around me. It was quite unusual, but easy to do and I feel much more relaxed now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;mindfulness and walking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://yogateacher.com/text/meditation/on-line/walking.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Kyle;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job! The goal of the walking exercise (or one of the goals, anyway) is to provoke precisely the type of experience that you had. Walking is a kind of gateway. Of course, anything can be a gateway, but walking is, by evolution, the most fundamentally human act. So, we seem to be tied to it in a very deep way. Running too.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I wish I could have had your intense focus when I went on my walk! But, I guess we're all a little different in the way we absorb the world around us. It's great that you were able to notice so many details (senses, sounds, etc) on your walk. </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>A Very Foggy Walk...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> Almost every day I go for a fifteen minute to an hour walk. Not because I particularly want to walk for myself, it is more for my Jack Russell than anything. I'll be honest here...walking for me is like a chore. Something that has to be done. A chore that I don't often look forward to after being on my feet for nine hours at work. On top of that, depending upon what day of the week it is, I walk my twenty-five minutes to and from the bus stop. I can't afford a car right now. It was either live on your own or have a car. I choose my own place. It's annoying not to be able to have that freedom, that independence that you have when you can actually get yourself around, wherever you want to go. The fact of the matter is -- the bus service here is shit. I'm waiting anywhere from ten to sixty minutes in the damn cold, standing, shivering, clutching my purse -- watching the mass of people driving by, all happily warm and content in their little perfect cars and their little perfect lives. I'm completely jealous of them, but like I said, I made my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So, for this week's activity, I tried not to look upon the walk as a chore, for once. I decided to go in the mid-afternoon on a day that I didn't have to work. That way, my feet wouldn't be sore and I wouldn't be in such a crummy, lazy mood. So I clipped the leash onto my dog's collar and we set off on our adventure together. I was glad I bundled up because it must have been around zero, or at least it felt like it was. There's still quite a bit of dirty, slushy snow here and the plough has just pushed it up into mini mountains on each side of the side walks. Who gives a crap about pedestrians? (I thought to myself). I let a little chuckle out and tried to keep myself from going into that gloomy mood I usually get into when walking. So Jack (my dog) and I walked on the road when there was no cars and when a car came we just plunged right into the mini snow mountains and waited patiently until it passed by. I have walked quite a bit around my little neighborhood and I've lived in this area for quite some time so it was hard not to concentrate on just getting lost in the situation. I usually have my mp3 player with me whenever I walk but this time I thought I'd leave it at home. I thought the absence of music would somehow let me absorb the peacefulness of my surroundings and better allow me to focus on the actual act itself. As we continued, the fog, that was only a mist when we left became thicker and denser. I tried to slow my breathing down by taking a nice long breath in though my nose and slowly exhale out through my mouth. I slowed down my usual quick pace and focused on the enjoyment and sounds of each step I took. Jacks muddy little paws and nails that needed to be clipped pitter pattered over the pavement in a musical rhythm while my loud booming boots seemed to accompany the sound. At that moment the sky began to mist and as I looked up I could see the dark grey, luminous clouds roll in. For a moment there, it looked as though the rain clouds had centered right upon only us but then as I watched more closely I could see them spreading more and more apart. My hair soon became sticky and wet and as I looked down at Jack he reminded me of a little wet rat, shivering but prancing along, smiling, tongue hanging out. I wished I could be so easily amused. Within what must have been just a few minutes, it began to just pour and soon I found myself picking up the pace again. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Fog is interesting, from a metaphoric point of view. And it seems like it was a good metaphor for you at this moment in your life (many possibilities, tough to see too far ahead, vision limited by circumstance). Although I can see how it would be bit of a drag to walk in the cold and the fog ... </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Not until I own five acres of my own</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> Two things have recently changed my walking patterns. I’ve moved to a rather hilly neighbourhood where a walk is more like a strenuous hike (and I don’t really care much for hiking to begin with) and I joined a gym (where I walk on a treadmill to warm up and most of my thoughts are aimed at cursing the people who are taking up the weights and machines I’m about to use). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to live near Commerical Drive in East Van and walked everywhere. Problem was, I daydream to the point that I’ll walk right by somebody I know without acknowledging their presence. Even a sharp, “REB-ECC-A!” followed by frantic waving doesn’t break the reverie. Once, I tried using a large headphone and Walkman combination, far more obvious and cheaper than the barely-visible iPod deal, and I was grazed by a car when I wasn’t paying attention while crossing the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walking and thinking has created problems for me (a certain instructor at this school still holds a grudge for what has turned into the blatant snub debacle) so I will stick to replacing my meditative walks with meditative hot showers. Needless to say, I am a very clean individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. Ross - can you tell what kind of tool I used to type this? Just curious...&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ya I'm not too down with the walking thing. I bought a car for a reason so that I did not have to take public transportation and be abused by stupid kids. The last time I remember actually walking somewhere some stupid guys decided it would be funny to throw an egg at me from there car. Lets say that hurt a lot and has made it hard for me to want to just walk for &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;. I'm totally down with the gym meditative cardio. I've started going back to the gym again and love the eliptical. I just plug in my mp3 player crank the techno and just run no where and everywhere at the same time to the beat of my music. I like this cause the beats of the techno drown out my thoughts and also don't really contain words to sing to. I find that I keep a really good empty head and just relax and also burn off any of the bad vibes I have. Good cardio can be a good means to shake off a bad day and is also very relaxing if you can just lose yourself. Also once you strap on the head phones and can't hear anyone you feel ok about wandering around the gym and taking in your surroundings. It's almost like your in your own bubble and nobody can say anything to you and you can't say anything to anyone else. Everything around you is fair game when your in your bubble place (if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will strongley have to debate the outdoor walking. Sorry Ross.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Psst. . . I don't think his post says it has to be outdoors. You could probably even do it alone in your apartment (though our 620 square feet would be a bit small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also public spaces that offer a degree of safety. . . botanical gardens, perhaps, or walking through the stacks of the library. The mall might be interesting, but quite a different experience. It also occurred to me after I posted this the first time that there may be Labyrinths here in town expressly for this purpose. I found one, at St. Paul's Anglican Church. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider yourselves lucky. . . when I took another of Ross's classes, we did this downtown and walked around the main Post Office. For the most part, it was uneventful (though we did temporarily lose one person, and another took it a bit too slow through the crosswalk). Kind of interesting, actually, how little people paid attention, even though I felt quite conspicuous. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'll try mine this time down by the Fraser River near our office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> I know the post did not specifically say outdoors. But, like you, I live in a condo and when I walk around it, I find many other things that I should do (like dishes, folding laundry, etc.) that lead to easy distractions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no way I'm going to get in my car and drive to a place just so I can walk somewhere and let the brain wander (especially in this city where driving, for the most part, is a massive pain). As I said before, I do my best mental traveling when there's absolutely no chance of distraction. Like sitting in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@ Melissa - That sucks! @ Ross - re-read the question to you about wondering if you could tell what kind of program I was using to type this and it occurred to me that it sounded a bit cheeky. I was honestly wondering if, on your side of the computer screen, if you can tell what's been written in what program and pasted here. I'm assuming probably not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Sorry, I was responding to both posts simultaneously, hence the outdoors comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the question is, can you ignore the distractions? It's not about mental travelling so much as it is about noticing. . . noticing that you're being distracted by laundry, noticing your tendency to mentally travel, etc., and not getting sucked in by it. Make sense? Noticing that you're thinking &amp;quot;This is a really silly thing to do and I think my instructor is crazy.&amp;quot; ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mind's a funny thing. Mine has its own particular hamster wheel of things it hashes and rehashes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>@ Tierney: Ah, no need to apologize. I was pretty much throwing out the idea that meditative walking could perhaps be replaced by another activity (or non-activity). I do think the meditative process is important and not at all a silly thing do do (ha! @ your comment) which is why I find that I pretty much have to be locked away from any potential distractions.Including the various organizing projects I have in my condo that beg to be finish. Anyway, hope I didn't come off as being snarky in my post, it wasn't my intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>My Walking Experience...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk almost everyday on a treadmill with my Ipod. But, instead of walking on a machine, I thought I would change it up a bit and go for a walk outdoors and I left my Ipod fully intact on its charger. As soon as I stepped outside of my home in Cloverdale, I felt the cool breeze hit me. I don’t usually go for walks in the winter for obvious reasons, so the first thing I noticed was the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have my Ipod with me, I’m never really aware of my surroundings when I’m walking because the music just seems to fade everything out. I’m actually glad that I left it at home that morning because I just felt more conscious of everything that was around me, ie. smells, sounds, the way things look, etc. (things I’ve just never really noticed before). Halfway into my walk, I noticed myself breathing more heavily since I was walking uphill. I’ve never really paid attention to the sound of my breathing because usually my Ipod covers it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes before I reached my house, I felt quite invigorated and refreshed and I completely forgot that I was freezing earlier. It was different from what I’m use to on the treadmill. Staring at a blank wall isn’t nearly as exciting as walking outdoors with nothing ever guaranteed to be the exact same. There’s always a surprise...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes: walking on a treadmill and wearing an iPod is certainly not the type of thing that is likely to still the internal dialog and deliver you into the creative space that is essential for good writing. So your instinct was correct, and I'm glad you found the experience useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creativity arises from silence and from the body's own wisdom. These things need to be listened to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>What's up with the fog?</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The door knob is chilly, almost a subzero temperature. On any other day I would complain to myself about how damn cold the metal feels against my skin, but winter brings chill - especially this winter, so I guess I have no reason to complain since it’s early morning and the sun has yet to rise. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;My breathing is deep and slow - breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, and breathe out. Like a child, once I realize how cold the temperature is outside I begin to breathe through my mouth to create the illusion of a smoky dragon. The smoke blends in with the thick cloud of fog that surrounds my body, it covers me like a fluffy feather-down jacket. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The air feels different today than other days. Moist, damp, cool and clean. It creates a tingling sensation whenever I take a deep breath. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Nonetheless, I begin my walk down the street. Cars zoom past the curb that acts as a catwalk runway that never seems to end. Thump, thump, thump. My oversized rain boots weigh my body down and each step I take makes me feel as though I am a giant that crushes everything in its way. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Solitude and isolation is impossible to come by on this street. As the motorists continue on their way, they create a gust of air that blows my hair awkwardly towards the front of my face, covering my eyes and obstructing my view even more so than the fog has already done. I push it out of the way, but it’s no match for the constant flow of traffic that comes down my street each and every morning. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Thoughts run through my head as I continue walking along the path that has no end. Where am I going? Why can’t I see the street signs ahead of me? What happened to the beautiful white snow that was here only a week ago? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Thump, Thump, Thump. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;My feet become even heavier than before; perhaps it is because I’m walking through icy snow that used to be as white as fluffy clouds. Now it is covered in mud, dirt, rocks and sand. No wonder it feels so much heavier than it used to. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Eventually I return home. From the front of my driveway I can’t even see my garage door; the fog is too thick, even for the bright blue paint that frames my house.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Nothing is able to defeat this Vancouver weather. Nothing.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Cool. Nice job. The intent of this exercise involves noticing ourselves and what's around us -- that's where a writer begins, after all -- and it seems you have done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Solitude and isolation is impossible&amp;quot; should read &amp;quot;Solitude and isolation are impossible&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to avoid the words &amp;quot;even&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to avoid words ending in -ly and -ing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Caprice, I loved reading your walk because I could really picture your walk. It seems like we had similar experiences, wandering minds and sort of focusing in on one thing. We both really seemed to concentrate on the weather around us, but with the way it has been these past weeks you can't help but think about it. </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Talking after walking</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> I don't walk nearly as often as I used to, thanks in no part to my car. However, today's walk made me realize what I've been missing out on. I did not take anything with me on my walk, no wallet, phone, keys or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was enveloped in this thick fog that's been present here in the last few days and I was struck with how much influence the weather can have on your sense of surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fog made it seem as if wherever I went, it was a small and enclosed area, with the unyielding fog acting as a constantly moving room, allowing me to only see what was present within its walls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the weather been a clear blue sky, things would surely have been different, but not necessarily better. I admit that I prefer gray skies, rain and fog to sunshine and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also aware of the serenity that the fog gave my neighbourhood, likening it to a constantly shifting room, the mood out on the streets was tranquil and calm. Walking in this setting gave me a sense of...freshness? I'm not sure what word to use but that one seems to be the only one I can come up with. &lt;br /&gt;*Note* I just read Amanjit's post and the word I was looking for is invigorated. Thanks Amanjit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed was that I really hate automobiles. I hate the sounds they make, how fast they move and that they were disturbing the peace and quiet I was so enjoying. I'm sure there are some driver's around this area wondering why that guy was glaring at them so venomously as they drove past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my walk, I felt very relaxed and peaceful and I'm thinking of making this into a regular activity from now on. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>An outstanding result! Well done. That's the impression we're going for. Walking and other similar activities allow us to slow down, to see more, to become more aware, to recognize the connections and disruptions between things -- to find, in short, the gateway to the creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>We shared a similar &amp;quot;shifting room&amp;quot; fog-like experience, my old friend. Likely we were wandering a mere block away from one another or perhaps on the very same street but it would be impossible to know because that fog allowed us to exist almost within our own minds or realities. </MESSAGE>

I know what you mean about them being ridiculously loud, while waiting for the bus after school I can't even hear myself think. Which would have reall hindered my walk had I tried it after school hahaha!</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Normally when I walk, I walk with my dog, a very hyper border colly.  When walking with my dog, I often get frustrated, as she stops to sniff the flowers or a bug that interests her.  Then she'll all of a sudden to get a burst of energy an want to run toward the park or a landmark in the distance.  This time, when walking my dog, instead of just getting through a 15 minute walk for her to do her business and release some energy, as weird as it sounds, I decided to take a walk through my dogs perspective.  When she stopped to sniff a flower, I also stopped to admire or peer at what she was sniffing. In doing this I felt much more relaxed, and discovered that our world/ my neighborhood is a lot more interesting than at first glance.  For the first time I was able to admire some of the gorgeous flowers that my neighbor grows and really take in their beauty.  </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Excellent! A dog's perspective is a wonderful way to think about this exercise. We could learn a great deal from such a perspective: about nature, about the currents of energy running through the world, about ourselves. And, of course, we see the flowers. </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Meditative Walking Exercise in City Park</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> For this meditative walking exercise, I have chosen to have a walk in the park that is 5 minutes walk away from my apartment on Sw Marine Drive. Since i do not have a practice to have a walk for leisure but rather go to gym for a cardio, this exercise allow me to connect myself with the outside environment while walking. Before the exercise, I did some simple preparation. First I chosen to wear something that is rather light weight so that I do not feel too much things on myself and have a better connection with the environment. Second, I did not bring any electric devices such as ipod, phone, and watches. I hope there will be absolutely no distractions, and more focus on the walk. Last, I bought a piece of paper and a black ink pen to draw and &amp;quot;enso&amp;quot; before and after the walk. I want to see is there any difference after the walk when I draw the &amp;quot;enso&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the park, it was dark and foggy. I did feel a little bit cold but it does make me feel more clam and focus. I took three deep breath and then sat on the bench for few minutes. I tried to clam myself and don't think of anything in my mind. When my eyes were close, I notice that I could feel the environment is connecting with me. I could smell the moist, mud and wood in the air. I heard different sound in the park. There were some crows flew by, and there are some sounds from two people footsteps. After few minutes, I opened my eyes and drew an enso. It is not a perfect circle but it almost touches the edge of the page. I stood up and start my walk. I took baby steps and walk slow. Sometimes I did close my eyes and tried to use my five senses to feel, sense, listen, smell, and see the environment around me. I saw the ground are full of small dark color wood chips with some sand. I felt the air is moist and cold. I smelt the wood, mud and moist in the air. I saw the new planted tree with no leaves, and some muddy snow on the short green bushes. When I close my eyes, at one time i feel there is some pressure on my forehead. There is no images in my mind but some darker shadow giving some sort of pressure on my forehead. I kept on walking and eventually I feel it is not as strong. When I got back to the starting point, I took three deep breath and then draw an enso. This time it is smaller but almost a full circle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the walk, I feel more refreshing and less pressure. I feel my body somehow is lighter, and I seem get more energy as in not as tiring (since I had whole day of school). I think that I have a better feel of the environment than before. I had moved into this neighborhood for four years and I had not physically walk around the neighborhood at all. I think I'm too used to driving to one point to another. I did not have a chance to look at the neighborhood in a better way. I think people should have try this out. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Very contemplative and Zen-like. I appreciated the Enso as an added bonus. Nicely done. Great use of the senses, too. Also, it seems to be a general rule that this type of walking is invigorating rather than tiring, if you open yourself to it. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I began my walk through the fog I couldn't help but notice how little snow is left. Aside from the large piles in parking lots that is. But the rain is quite the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;googie_link&quot; is_corrected=&quot;false&quot; g_id=&quot;0&quot; googie_action_btn=&quot;1&quot;&gt;effecient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cleaner, it can wash away the snow, leaves and dirt. As a writer, I find it very difficult to shut my mind off and think of nothing, when I try to think of nothing, I start to think about random things which then always lead back to something important. So, instead of clearing my mind, I just stuck with the first thing that came to my mind and let my mind wander from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, rain, water. Not only does it clear the streets and yards, it clears the mind and soul. Or in my case, focuses the mind. I continue on my way, walking through my quiet neighbourhood. People are out with their dogs, friends or just by themselves. They're all taking advantage of the somewhat dry weather, which makes me think that the rain doesn't just clear natural things from the street, it clears the people from the street. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep going, I try to listen to my feet on the ground, they still find some of the sand that hasn't been washed away. I try to focus on the sound, but it just makes me wish I had brought along my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;googie_link&quot; is_corrected=&quot;false&quot; g_id=&quot;1&quot; googie_action_btn=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Ipod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. There isn't much to look at in my area, a typical suburban neighbourhood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slowly start to head home, the rain is starting to fall again. I do realize I can hear things I wouldn't have otherwise been able to hear, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;googie_link&quot; style=&quot;color: green&quot; is_corrected=&quot;true&quot; g_id=&quot;2&quot; googie_action_btn=&quot;1&quot; old_value=&quot;brids&quot; is_changed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;birds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, sirens, the sand again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get home and go to my computer and I am again thinking of water. This is because my desktop wallpaper is of a beach in Maui. This gets me excited for my upcoming trip, at the end of the school year I will get to celebrate my graduation and cousin's wedding in Maui. From their my mind wanders to the assignments that I will have to do and the tests I will have to take. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know if this assignment worked on me because, as I said, I have never been able to completely clear my mind, it keeps me up at night. I worry when there is nothing to worry about, like I'm missing something. But I did find the walk helped me focus on something rather than jumping from thought to thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes: this type of process really highlights how much of our minds are occupied with one thing or another. And walking in this way is very useful, with practice, in stilling that chatter, which is one of the most challenging habits of consciousness for many writers. It took me a long time to learn how to turn off my internal dialog and enter the creative space that is beyond words. That's where all great writing comes from: that space beyond words. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I followed my own advice and did the walking last night in the apartment just before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the lights already off, I paced the floor from the front door to the other side of the living room and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that, even though we are near the top of a tower downtown, I seldom look outside. Usually, my husband is home, and the lights and TV are on. His desk is next to the window wall, and his habit of smoking, which he's tried to quit many times, exiles him to the balcony in even the coldest of weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chuckled at the distant sound of an impatient driver honking his horn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also the conspicuous glow of the constellation of electronic devices on and around my husband's desk, set against the relative darkness of the rest of the apartment. This is a persistent argument between us; I have adopted earplugs and a sleep mask to block out the nighttime whistles and chirps and subwoofs and telephone conversations after I go to bed. But it runs deeper than that, to a persistent inability to turn himself off, to sit quietly with a book, to watch a movie without running a commentary or distracting himself with something else. Though I often distract myself with other things, I like the quiet. And I am beginning to realize just how much. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Tierney;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, walking inside in a small space can be very interesting. I used to do a meditation group in which one of our exercises was simply to walk across the room -- about 12 feet -- and take about thirty minutes to do it. Very slow movement, and very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, the chatter -- whether it's us, or someone else -- is interesting, and meaningful in all kinds of ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, try to walk across a span of ten feet in 30 minutes, then half the distance but take the same amount of time, then half it again. In a small apartment, no end of possibilities! </MESSAGE>

That was such an odd experience because you had students pass you while you moved at snail pace in a line up down the mini forest. I remember feeling really self conscious to start but then I realized that it was better to not look at the other people and focus on the walking also I would remind myself that I wasn't the only one who looked crazy.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I pause for a moment in my walk, recollecting the icy patch where I have fallen. Images of shredded pantyhose, shredded skin, and dried blood blossom and wither in a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is cold, and mounds of gray-brown slush pile up against the sides of the sidewalk, I move quickly, almost mechanically. My limbs are pulled forwards, cutting sharp angles to the pavement below. I feel as if a rope is tied around my abdomen, pulling me forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could hear the beating of my heart or pause to examine the way my breath curls and vanishes in the air, but I need to be somewhere. Even when I fell, I jumped up quickly, barely uttering a grunt, not pausing to examine the site of the wound. Just keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrive at a bus stop and perch on top of a mound of iced over snow. The bus is late, and the traffic rushes with an unfeeling coldness past me. When did everything become so fast? Nobody walks anymore. I see three larger-than-life advertisements on various billboards, and in the bus stop window. TV shows, tourist destinations. Neon-bright colours that no one notices anymore. Keeping their eyes on the road, they miss the things beside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the middle of this all, I have become obsessed with speed too. I look up at the sky for the first time in the day - I note the clouds, and the way the sun looks like a pale, luminous hole shot through all the gray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I see a man in a blue turban, tottering down the sidewalk towards the Muslim Temple behind me, cane jittering loosely against the ground. He looks up at me, smiles and waves. I smile and wave back.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

Speediness is one of the challenges (see my response to Tierney). So much of creativity is about slowing down, paying attention, noticing things.

Nice concluding sentence. Try this:

&quot;I glimpse a man in a blue turban. He totters down the sidewalk toward the Muslim temple behind me. His cane jitters loosely against the ground. He looks up, smiles and waves. I smile and wave back.&quot;

7 changes. See if you can find them all.
Tighter.

                <MESSAGE>I'd been sitting in the library for hours and the sounds of the terribly annoying &lt;br /&gt;kids around me were starting to sound like hyenas in my ears. So I tried the meditative walking exercise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was probably the first time in years I'd gone for a walk without the explicit purpose of smoking a cigarette so it felt fairly strange. At first it felt kind of uncomfortable because I didn't have any music or anything to distract me, but I fell into a groove fairly fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next challenge was clearing my head but eventually I simply focused on walking and breathing. It was actually quite relaxing concentrating on the breaths of air going in and out of my lungs as I marched along. Everything else kind of faded and it was good to de-stress for a while. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was nice to get some fresh air, but I had to go back to the library with the hyenas eventually. Now I'm doing a meditative metal exercise with my ipod and it's working fairly well too. In all honesty, meditating in my house with an old record on works alot better if I'm going to meditate, but I'll probably try the walking thing again because it was a nice change.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Nice job. A good, basic walk.
And yes, many people find it uncomfortable to walk without music or some other type of distraction. But that's the point, isn't it: to remove distraction and truly see.

Here's one of your original sentences and a suggested revision:

It was actually quite relaxing concentrating on the breaths of air going in and out of my lungs as I marched along. Everything else kind of faded and it was good to de-stress for a while. 

I relaxed, and focused on the breaths moving in and out of my lungs. I marched along. All else faded. My stress left me.

                <SUBJECT>an unfocused walk</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;This meditative walk was a new experience for me. I’m not a big walker, and when I seldom do, I bring my ipod. I loved the idea of walking without a destination. It seemed calming and something out of the ordinary from my somewhat chaotic lifestyle. So I stepped out of my Vancouver home, into the fog, and began my meditative walk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to wander. I wandered down my street, around the park, and through my neighborhood. While walking, I could not help but focus on how much I was blinking. Maybe it was the timing of the walk, or how much sleep I got that night. Once my blinking rhythm went back to somewhat normal, I tried to refocus on my breathing. Whenever I do yoga or pilates, there is focus on breathing patterns, and this is something I have trouble with. It is hard for me to stay focused for very long, and my mind ends up going on random tangents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, my walk in the fog made my head a little foggy. (No pun intended…ha…..ha) I don’t know what it was but without my ipod I kept thinking too hard! Thinking about writing about this exercise, thinking about when I get paid, thinking about when I have to pay my speeding ticket, what time I have to pick up my new phone etc, etc. Not saying I didn’t enjoy the walk, but I wish my brain would just shut off for once! Once I become a more “experienced” meditative walker, all of these things will hopefully improve and I plan on going on more meditative walks indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any tips for next time would be more than appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

Start over if you lose count. It's been a long time since I read it, but I seem to recall that in Marian Mountain's &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Zen Environment &lt;/span&gt;this is described as the only meditation technique you really need. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Well, I think you really hit the nail on the head, so to speak. This exercise is about noticing the incessant chatter and trying to find ways to turn it down a bit. Your awareness of the chatter -- though uncomfortable -- helps to frame the challenge. 

It would be bad if the brain just shut off. But I get your point...</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> The area of the repair shop at Mt. Baker resembled a waiting room in a doctor’s office; full of unhappy and impatient people with broken equipment. At first I thought the kid working on the waxing table only had one arm but when he turned around I saw that he was wearing a sling underneath his shirt. A freshly separated shoulder, apparently. The kid nodded towards the line-up and told me he couldn’t work as fast as usual so fixing my binding would take about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought it was as good as a time as any to go for a meditative walk. I headed towards the edge of the run, along the edge of the parking lot. My mind was already somewhat quiet due to a combination of having already done three runs and going on four hours’ sleep. As I continued along a nearby path, the chattering buzz of the lodge and the hum of the nearby chairlift faded away. I concentrated on hitting the parts of the path that hadn’t already been walked on, finding great satisfaction in the crunching of my snowboard boots on untouched, hard snow. The path was lined by deep forest on both sides and was hidden from the sun, reminding me that it was still winter, unlike the spring-like 15 degrees on the hill. I then started thinking about work, about various family and friends, about their lives, about… I stopped myself with the realization that I had forgotten the basis of the assignment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started focusing on the basics of walking, the mechanics of placing one foot in front of the other, of keeping a good posture, of deep breathing, of not letting my brain get stuck into stressful ruts. I thought about what a good friend, a Feldenkrais advocate, had said about body awareness, how it felt so good to be aware of how the body moves. I felt like I was sleep-walking. Then I realized my board was probably ready for me to pick up about 10 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

Thinking, walking, thinking, walking. That's how it goes. An ongoing battle for everyone.

Body awareness is, indeed, the key.

                <SUBJECT>My Walk</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I decided to try the meditative walking exercise after work one day. I don't do much walking for the sake of walking around here... I usually drive when I need to get somewhere and go to the gym to get the cardio in. I found this walk to be a different experience, I enjoyed it but did not get all I wanted out of it. I left my cell phone at home so as not to be distracted, but i found that all i wanted to do was pull it out and see how long I had been taking. I ignored this and kept walking, trying to enjoy my neighbourhood. I walked toward a busier street and tried to focus on clearing my mind, but the sounds of cars and other people seemed to drown out my thoughts, so I stuck with just wandering around closer to my house. Perhaps I should have tried a more interesting place. I think it would be easier to clear my mind if it was a new scene I was taking in. It's so much easier to walk when you can enjoy the scenery. One thing I noticed was that I enjoyed not having my ipod headphones in, which surprised me. I usually get lost in music, but without it I seemed to be much more aware of my surroundings and my thoughts. For the first time i noticed the miniature palm tree looking plant in the front yard of a house at the end of my street. I didn't understand it, but I noticed it. It can't be new because who would buy a palm tree and plant it in the snow? I have no idea when it got there, but it made me realize how unperceptive I can be. While I did find it hard to clear my head, and spent a lot of time thinking &amp;quot;no stop thinking about that&amp;quot;, I enjoyed walking. It left me with a completely different feeling that the one I get after walking on the elliptical at the gym, and it helped me get work completely off my mind. I'm going to try to continue with this exercise, especially as it starts to get nicer outside, because although I didn't get as much as I hoped to from it, I think that it was a mind opening experience of sorts. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>There was fog last night.&lt;br /&gt;A thick potato stew fog that swallowed the bridge and barnston whole. I stood on the ridge and could not see the iron tracks at the river's shore. There was no river, only heavy lights to guide the bridge across to nothing. &lt;br /&gt;There were coyote tracks, the smoke wagging after their tails, heading for the missing river. The rushing noise in the air wasn't water, but cars floating on the bridge deck, their glowbug lights arcing over the void. The river's silent, gone for the night. The night serves only potato stew, and sunset was days ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now, there will be creamiscles on the horizon and blue ices to stain my mouth violent. Now is for grey nights and a bridge that does not connect. More glowbugs litter the void, catching the last ferry across the river, silver in their eyes. &lt;br /&gt;The coyotes drift by, shining headlights for eyes, bellies swaying like their tails, like the fog. I too turn homeward, tasting violet on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Haha I love the imagery here...I can picture your walk. As much as it sounds beautiful, it sounds so amusing...tasting the icicles, tasting the air, tasting the potato stew. Definetely a keeper &lt;img title=&quot;approve&quot; alt=&quot;approve&quot; src=&quot;https://elearning.kwantlen.ca/courses/theme/chameleon/pix/s/approve.gif&quot; /&gt; You could consider turning this into a poem as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now whenever I look at a car, I will most likely think of &amp;quot;glowbug&amp;quot; lights - what a great description!&lt;/p&gt;

                <SUBJECT>Can't get it off my mind.</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> I stepped outside the door at three in the morning. I couldn't see anything beyond a twenty foot radius. It was fog, alot of it. I began to walk.&lt;br /&gt; To be honest I expected to have some calming walk where I think about the same things as I normally think about. I was wrong. At the beginning of September I was forced to put down something I love (Elizabethan Fencing) because my school schedule interfered to heavily. As I walked my mind continued to bring me back to a realization I had this summer about my fencing. After a bout with a fellow swordsman-- where I was masterfully out played-- I came to realize that I was well out of practice. That thought, coupled with the lack of time, ended up in a strange, temporary withdrawal from the sport.&lt;br /&gt; After about a half hour of walking and thinking solely of Fencing. I decided that there was never a more clear sign that I needed to return to Fencing. So the following Thursday I dusted off my gear and went to practice. As fate would have it, THAT was the day to be there because one of the greatest Rapier fighters of the pacific coast had traveled to our area and was speaking as a guest instructor.&lt;br /&gt; This instructor's lesson opened my eyes to the fighting style and the form that I had previously been striving for and had lost hold of. That &amp;quot;synchronistic&amp;quot; meeting has set me back on this path of &amp;quot;swordsman enlightenment&amp;quot;. It may have nothing to do with writing... but I feel happier.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Looks like that walk really made you realize how important Fencing is to you. Sometimes when we love to do something (whether it be writing, playing, sports, dancing, etc) and somewhere along the path of life -- we find that we are just too busy and eventually (or suddenly, like you) have to quit doing it. We miss it, but we are so wrapped up in the craziness of life, we often don't have time to think about it. I think that's how a lot of people quit doing the things that they love...&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we need those quiet moments: like a walk or some form of meditation to really make us think about those things we really love and miss doing. Glad that you were able to do that.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Sarah </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I find that sometimes walking does this for me too...it allows you to re-focus and get out of your daily routine. I have had some of my more important realizations on walks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabethan fencing? That is totally awesome. Just curious, what kind of gear do you have to wear to do that?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I sometimes get this strange focusing of thoughts on nights where I'm unable to sleep, and seeing as you posted this at three in the morning, I'm sure the feelings are quite similar. Perhaps its the calmness of the night, the lack of ambient sounds and sights that allow you to lose yourself in your thoughts. I find that nighttime is when some of my best thoughts and ideas are conceive. It's only a matter of hanging onto them long enough to get them down on some paper or a computer, as you were lucky enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Best. . . assignment. . . ever</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> I've been waiting for this assignment to go back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;diacritical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work with words in many languages, and diacritics (or diacritical marks) describe all the squigglies on letters -- the accents, cedillas, umlauts (another favorite word, fun to say), tildes, etc. I like that there's a word that collectively describes them, as well as words describing each type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gestalt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like saying Gestalt (&lt;span class=&quot;pronset&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;show_spellpr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pron&quot;&gt;g&lt;span class=&quot;ital-inline&quot;&gt;uh&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;boldface&quot;&gt;shtahlt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). And I like Fritz Perls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lagniappe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagniappe is a word I grew up with. It's originally from the Quechua language, which makes it doubly likable. According to Wikipedia, &amp;quot;Mark Twain writes about the word [lagniappe] in a chapter on New Orleans in &lt;i&gt;Life on the Mississippi&lt;/i&gt; (1883).&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We picked up one excellent word — a word worth travelling to New Orleans to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy word — &amp;quot;lagniappe.&amp;quot; They pronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish — so they said. We discovered it at the head of a column of odds and ends in the Picayune, the first day; heard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it meant the third; adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a restricted meaning, but I think the people spread it out a little when they choose. It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a &amp;quot;baker's dozen.&amp;quot; It is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The custom originated in the Spanish quarter of the city.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boustrophedon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *love* the first syllable, Greek for ox. The word describes writing that goes left to right, then right to left across the page, like an ox plowing a field. Really, I just like words that are outliers, that I look at and think, &amp;quot;Huh. Someone, somewhere, decided we needed a word for that, and it actually stuck.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;barefoot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Jacob Bronowski wrote: “It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it.” To me, barefootedness has lots of associations -- with the martial arts, with childhood. There's even a group online dedicated to barefootedness -- the Dirty Sole Society. I hate, however, that we've tarnished the word's wholesome, free-spirited goodness with the phrase &amp;quot;barefoot and pregnant.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xibalba&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of the Mayan underworld. The Maya have too many neat words to mention -- they have a bat-god named Zotz. What's not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my God&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't a single word (unless you speak Aramaic), but I'll throw it in anyway. It shows up often in my poems, and refers to a personal God, as opposed to the Roman Catholic God-I-grew-up-with. I like to re-vision my God as a much nicer deity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;quirky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a childhood of being called &amp;quot;weird,&amp;quot; I much prefer this word. It lacks the connotation of social misfit, and is a bright, happy, fun word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;belly button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it occurred to me that all mammals (save platypuses) have belly buttons, listing off the animals that do made me laugh. I started with the fact that my dog has a belly button, and kept going. Elephants must have *huge* belly buttons. It's a child's term, and makes me feel giddy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;duende&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first learned about this, Federico Garcia Lorca's word, in John Lee's &lt;i&gt;Writing from the Body&lt;/i&gt;. It is &amp;quot;the mystery, the roots that probe through the mire that we all know of and do not understand.&amp;quot; For an interesting essay on poetry and duende: &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5898&quot;&gt;http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5898&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Diacritical is a great word, and I always surprised how few people know what it means. It doesn't even shop up in many common dictionaries.


  Diacritic \Di`a*crit&amp;quot;ic\, Diacritical \Di`a*crit&amp;quot;ic*al\, a. [Gr.
     ?, fr. ? to separate, distinguish; dia` through + ? to
     separate. See {Critic}.]
     That separates or distinguishes; -- applied to points or
     marks used to distinguish letters of similar form, or
     different sounds of the same letter, as, [=a], [a^], [aum],
     [=o], [o^], etc. &amp;quot;Diacritical points.&amp;quot; --Sir W. Jones.
     [1913 Webster]
  
           A glance at this typography will reveal great
           difficulties, which diacritical marks necessarily throw
           in the way of both printer and writer.   --A. J. Ellis.
     [1913 Webster]

From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:

  diacritical
      adj 1: capable of distinguishing; &amp;quot;students having superior
             diacritic powers&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;the diacritic elements in culture&amp;quot;-
             S.F.Nadel [syn: {diacritic}, {diacritical}]

Gestalt is great too, with multiple meanings.

Boustrophedon? What a crazy word. Useful, I suppose, if you're writing about hieroglyphics:

                <MESSAGE> Gawd, Ross, stop with the book recommendations already. As voraciously as I read, I'll still never have time for them all. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I was not aware of your admiration for Bronowski. I don't know how I came across the quote, but just found it again in a book I am reading about gifted education -- &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Barefoot Irreverence&lt;/span&gt;, by Jim Delisle. Apparently he likes the quote too, as he named his book after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings to mind another word:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eponymous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;self-named, and, cleverly, the name of a really good R.E.M. album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Growing up in New Orleans is an education in creative spelling. If you think lagniappe is bad, try Tchoupitoulas. ;)&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Lethargic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning tired, or sluggish. This word fascinates me because it is rarely ever used in everyday dialect. Everyone just says, “I’m so tired.” You never hear anyone saying, “I’m so lethargic.” I can honestly say that I have never heard anyone use this word in a conversation, yet I read it in different literature pieces all the time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 18pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Libbard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning leopard. The first time I saw this word in William Cowper’s poem, “The Winter Walk at Noon,” I didn’t know what it meant. But, recently I came upon a different version of the same poem (with some words translated), and I finally realized what libbard meant. So, if anyone ever asks me what a libbard is, I can tell them exactly what it means! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Zephyrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning gentle breeze. There’s just something about this word that I like. I think it’s just the way that it is spelt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Stupendous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning astonishingly great or large. When I was younger, I thought that this word meant ‘stupid’ because it has the first 4 letters of ‘stupid’, and I remember my elementary-school teachers always using this word to compliment my work or that of a classmate. So, I have always been confused by this word. But, not so much anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Adieu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- a French word, meaning farewell or goodbye. This word always reminds me of the Spanish word for goodbye, ‘adios.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Murmur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning to speak softly or indistinctly. I just like the sound that this word makes when you say it aloud. It reminds me of an example of onomatopoeia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Abstemious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning not self-indulgent. I saw this word in a poem by George Crabbe, entitled, “The Parish Register” and the language in the poem is very simple. But, this word stood out to me because it’s not a simple word. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Auriculas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning yellow-flowered primrose. Anytime I see this word, it reminds me of the word ‘tarantulas’...(Definition wise, I was really off!) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Lustrous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning having a sheen or glow. I have found this word used occasionally in novels that I have read to describe an object and I like that this word can immediately add some color/vibrancy to a story. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoListParagraph&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Tranquil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;- meaning peaceful or free from disturbance. Whenever&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I see this word used in literary works, I immediately think of the spa. For me, reading a book provides a sense of tranquility so when I see this word, it’s like I am experiencing it simultaneously with the character in the book. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>lustrous is a great word, as is murmur. Another related one is sussurous.
But that's fairly arcane...

                <MESSAGE>&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 Best Words &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(In no particular order) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Awestruck (to be filled with awe): I like this word because, to me, it gives more description than surprised. You are &amp;quot;struck&amp;quot; with awe, caught off guard and I feel it just isn't used enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Relentless (Steady and persistent. Doesn't stop): Again, this word isn't used as often as much as it should be. I also just like way it sounds, something about the way it rolls off your tongue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Behoove (Worth while to. Advantage): To be honest, I had never really paid any attention to this word until my photojournalism instructor used it. Not many of us in the class knew what she was talking about and thus had to tell us. From there on out she would laugh every time she used the word. It is just a funny little memory I have associated with the word, and now I notice how frequently it is used. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Mischievous (causing annoyance, harm or trouble): When I was younger, this word was my nemesis. I could never spell it. Now that I am older, obviously I can and I just like the image it brings. A cute little kid that acts playful and nice but is a sneaky mastermind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Anemone (A sea anemone): I just can't help but think of Finding Nemo and little Nemo trying to say this word. It was cute. That is the only reason I like and I stand by it. haha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Triskaidekaphobia (Fear of the #13): This is just nuts. It is a specific form of superstition. And, as with a number of my other words, I have a popular culture reference. In an episode of Friends, Joey auditions to host a game show and while practicing with Chandler and Ross he asks for the definition of this word. Ross answers with &amp;quot;the fear of triscuits.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Onomatopoeia (A word that is formed around the sound made or associated with it): I needed to include a literary word in here. This has always been my favorite because it is easy to remember, it has to do with a sound and it makes makes an awesome sound when it is said. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Swashbuckler (Daredevil, adventurer): Even though it isn't in the definition, this word is also associated with pirates. And it couldn't be more fitting, swash- leads me to think of water and sloshing around. Buckler-because of all of the buckles on their suits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Buttery-Burning-Gold (the description of Amber coloured eyes): So this was random, but when reading Breaking Dawn, I had to laugh when I read this. Stephanie Meyer was really working the description of Edward's eyes. It is completely relevant and a good description because it really gives you an image of his eyes, however, it had become quite redundant at that point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Redundant (Repetitive): This is kind of a selfish reason for liking this word, I love pointing out redundancies in everything I see, read or hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Come to think of it, I used to have a little old hardbound medical dictionary and the phobias and manias were some of my favorite words. Trichotillomania (obsessive hairpulling) was one of them. I'm sure triskaidekaphobia was in there too.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

Relentless is a good standby word. I haven't had much cause to use Triskaidekaphobia (Deca is ten, and Tri is three, from Greek: decade and triangle are related words, obviously).

Onomatopoeia is a universal favorite, and therefore is pretty much off the table for actual use.

If buttery-burning-gold describes eyes, I wonder about the experience of the person with those eyes. Are they on fire? As you say, it's a long stretch of a phrase...

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ecstasy: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;a feeling of intense pleasure. This word pops up in my poems quite often, I guess I like its descriptive properties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Zeitgeist: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;ideas and spirit of a particular time and place. I like the way it sounds and it’s a word I don’t usually come across very often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ruckus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; causing a noisy and unpleasant disturbance. This word packs a punch and I often use it for humorous purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Graceful:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; something or someone that is elegant, beautiful, poised, etc. I enjoy using this gorgeous adjective whenever I can. To me it’s such a pretty word (can words be pretty? Lol)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Zen:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; a school of Buddhism that emphasis enlightenment through meditation and insight. Even though the word “Zen” is classified as a noun I often use it as an adjective to describe something peaceful and serene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Crescendo:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; a gradual increase in volume of a particular object, noise, etc. I’m reading this cute little collection of short stories by Pam Houston (&lt;i&gt;Cowboys Are My Weakness)&lt;/i&gt; and I really like the way she used it in this sentence: “There is another crescendo of barking as Arlo’s cage is opened and he races out into the corridor.” It also reminds me of that Pizza brand and I think of that stupid commercial every time I hear it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Twilight:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; the time of day between sunset and dawn, when the sun is below the horizon. It’s just a beautiful word that I use often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Maudlin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; overly sentimental-easily brought to tears. I just like the way this word sounds and I don’t often see it used very often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Dungeon: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;a prison cell, often underground beneath a castle. I’ve used this word to describe a state of mind and the metaphor was quite effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Skittles:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; (the candy). I just think this is a fun word. I’d like to try using it as an adjective in my writing somehow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Maudlin is always reliably depressing, and it goes well with dungeon. Ecstasy is good too, but I always stumble on the spelling. And now there's a second assocaiton with that word in the drug culture. So, it has a complicated meaning.

Twilight is one of my favorite words also. Too bad it is the title of a too-popular book.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Maudlin is a great word, too. For some reason, I used to think that it meant tacky, or gawdy so I sometimes stuble over its meaning still. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Antiquarian– (one who knows antiques) – This is a beautiful word with a nice syllabic rhythm. I’ve also come to realize that the more vowels there are in the word, the more varied the word can be pronounced. The Q does that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnanimous– (generous)– I heard Kevin Newman use this word to describe Barack Obama earlier today, and it totally threw me off guard. I’m not too sure if I had heard it before, but the curious sounding of it really piqued my interest and I looked into it. It’s my newest favourite word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congenital– (inherited) – Even though the word starts with “con”, and it’s typically used in a negative context, I find that it has a very happy sound to it. Each individual syllable sounds rather harsh, but together it makes a really melodic word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramshackle – (run-down)– This is one of the greatest words to read or say. It sounds like gibberish, and it sounds like a positive word. But ramshackle is used to denote something old and decrepit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battle-ax– The informal use of the word, as we use it in society now, is in regards to a nagging woman. But neither battle nor ax has anything to do with nagging, yet it’s a great word and evokes great imagery. For me, it’s of a female Viking swinging a flail. Don’t ask why. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flummoxed– (perplexed)– This is a very happy sounding word. And it’s a bouncy sounding work. It’s a smooth word to say because of the bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mosaic– (collage, design)– This is a creatively evocative word for me. I’m not sure why, but mosaic creates beautiful coloured imagery in my mind of elaborate tiled artwork. It also reminds me of the tile game of the same name that came with Windows 95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shuck– (remove husk from)– This is the ugliest word I can think of, and I have thought this for a while. The “sh” and “uck” sounds clash so harsh, it just combines to make an ugly sounding word. But out of this ugliness, it becomes one of my favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diaphragm– (contraceptive, muscle under ribcage)– I think it’s the spelling that really attracts me to this word. The “ph” and the “agm” make it a very unusual looking word. But it’s a nice word to say, and despite the odd-looking spelling, it is s a very smooth word in speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schedule– The only reason I have this on my list is because this is one of many words that society allows to have drastically different pronunciations, and people are cool with that. And it bothers me. Schedule sounds like “sked-jewel”, not “shed-jul”.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

With congenital, I worry that I will mix it up -- or the reader will mix it up -- with congenial, or the other way around. Those are tricky words.

Shuck is a great onomatopoeic word, and it has many good companions:

From Moby Thesaurus II by Grady Ward, 1.0 [moby-thesaurus]:

  19 Moby Thesaurus words for &quot;shuck&quot;:
     bark, bran, capsule, case, chaff, corn shuck, cornhusk,
     decorticate, hull, husk, jacket, palea, peel, pod, rind, shell,
     skin, slough, strip

Flummoxed is good too. It's the word that I recommended to the students at Poppy Secondary a couple of weeks ago as a great choice to use on their Provincial exam essays as a verbal descriptor.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Shuck is also the word for opening an oyster. I have fond memories of watching the guy behind the bar at Bozo's (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.nola.com/anguslind/2008/04/bozo_turns_90.html&quot;&gt;http://blog.nola.com/anguslind/2008/04/bozo_turns_90.html&lt;/a&gt;) shuck oysters, and eating them by the half dozen (in months whose names contain the letter R) since I was about 5 or 6. Once, I insisted we take the oyster shells home, so my mother helped me wash them in the bathroom and we took them home. :)&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Those are some resonant words! Look how many of them have multiple vowel sounds. All of them, in fact. This tells us something about the power of vowels, and the reason that the meditative utterance Om is actually all the vowels together -- A E I O U Um. As you may remember from IDEA class, the Egyptians thought that vowels were the key to all magic.</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Pellucid - Allowing the maximum passage of light, as glass - translucent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castigate - To criticize or reprimand severely&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous - Existing or being everywhere at the same time, omnipresent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amorphous - Lacking definite form, having no specific shape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading D.H. Lawrence's &amp;quot;The Rainbow&amp;quot; for one of my classes, and I found most of these words within the novel. I fell quite in love with each of these words - my book has big circles and markings in the margins wherever Lawrence used them. His particular favorite seemed to be &amp;quot;Fecund&amp;quot; - that would be the defining trait of one of his characters. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Pellucid -- I'd forgotten about that word. It's a good one. Fecund, too. Languid is one I tend to over-use.

Yes, Lawrence is great with language. So many of the early 20th century writers were masters and mistresses of the rhythms and treasures of language. It's not something we see much of anymore, which is a great loss to our craft. Though see Chris Hedges, or William Langewiesche, of Sharon Olds. They preserve the thread.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I should definetely check out those writers. I love words, and I find that today the tendency in writing is to over-simplify. A handful of complex, well-placed words in a sentence is always a nice addition.</MESSAGE>

Excellent, simple choices. These words are resonant for our times. Identity and Ethnic are especially powerful, as is Ideologies. It's interesting how much of our language preferences derive from our own personal backgrounds.</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;Most words that I find interesting are words that just sort of roll of your tongue.  Words usually with more than one syllable or that give more meaning and richness to the sentence.  For example, for my first word how much more richness does it give to the sentence when you say to confabulate, then to chat.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

For example - disciple and perfector are religious words used to describe God and the followers of Christ. On the flip side they're also used in Slayer lyrics. The last 5 on the list just have a good resonance when they roll off my tongue. Reckoner is probably my favorite word of this second though because it just sounds badass. It sounds like the name on an antagonist in an old western that wears all black, when in reality it means an accountant.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

All hail the Crimson King, as they say (or, at least, as Stephen King says). Crimson in a powerful word. Phantasm is great too, as is synecdoche.

Revolver is much better than gun, as is pistol.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Yay for wolf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go by the online pseudonym Wolfish (Wolf-ish, meaning wolf-like, not Wolf-fish, which is a big ugly fish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wolfish is a really good word. I'd forgotten about that one.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Agitate – to disturb or excite emotionally (Although I don’t think I would use this word to describe an emotional excitement perse…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignobly – of low character, of low quality; inferior. A few weeks ago I came across this word as I was reading an essay for an English class and it was the first time I had ever heard it. Still trying to find a way to work it into my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snoop – to prowl or pry; to go about in a sneaking or prying way. I love the word and how it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinge - a jointed device or flexible piece on which a door, gate, shutter, lid, or other attached part turns, swings, or moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jubilation - a feeling of or the expression of joy or exultation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concubine - a woman who cohabits with a man to whom she is not legally married, especially one regarded as socially or sexually subservient; mistress. I took a class that focused on Southeast Asian cultures and societies and I kept hearing the word over and over again. I hate that it doesnt have a positive connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apocalypse - a prophetic revelation, especially concerning a cataclysm in which the forces of good permanently triumph over the forces of evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenestrate - to throw out of a window. Such a complicated word for such a simple action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradigm - a set of forms all of which contain a particular element, especially the set of all inflected forms based on a single stem or theme.&lt;/p&gt;Doppelganger - a ghostly double or counterpart of a living person. Scary thought, cool word. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Oh, defenestration is a great word, with a great etymology (it literally means &amp;quot;out of the window&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>My Choice Words</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>I noticed that on a lot of the posts that others have submitted for this assignment contain some of the most peculiar words that aren't very common in everyday writing - or at least not my writing. Anyway, rather than continuing with this trend and looking for the words that stand out the most, I decided to go with some of my favourite words that I see on a regular basis (or at least most of them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy =)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Exquisite:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;of such beauty or delicacy as to arouse intense delight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I commonly hear this word in movies and it is a common occurrence in a lot of romantic stories (such as Twilight). Whenever I see this word come up, it immediately brings about an image of a beautiful diamond ring or some sort of high-end jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Mortifying: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;to cause or experience shame, humiliation or a wounded pride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Seeing as how I am into a lot of horror and mystery screenwrites, this word can pretty much sum up most gory films in our present time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Marshmallow: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;a light, spongy, very sweet confection made of corn syrup, gelatin, sugar and starch and dusted with powder sugar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While walking through Metrotown tonight, I came across a new Rocky Road chocolate store that just opened up near the food court. They just so happened to be selling caramel covered marshmallows on a stick. For some odd reason I just kept reading the word &amp;quot;marshmallow&amp;quot; over and over again, thinking &amp;quot;how the heck did the creator of this food come up with the name marshmallow?&amp;quot;... any ideas?&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Chestershire Cat: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;a fictional cat with a broad fixed smile on its face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice in Wonderland is an instant classic for most kids growing up in the late 1980's... how can you not love this word?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Duplex: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A house divided into two living units or residences, usually having separate entrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Supercalafragalisticexpialadocious: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fantastic, very wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Do I even need to explain where this word comes from and why it's so great? Here is a fun fact though, when doing a search on the Online Dictionary website, this word doesn't exist in their database - weird.&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Flatulence: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The presence of excessive gas in the digestive tract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Treacherous: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Marked by unforeseen hazards; dangerous or deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Bedazzled: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;To dazzle so completely as to make blind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When I was a kid, I used to have one of those ghetto Bedazzeler machines that you could order over the phone from a infomercial hot line. Ever since then, I would always refer to really busy clothing items as being very &amp;quot;bedazzled&amp;quot; (ex: Ed Hardy products are soooooo bedazzled!)&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Agoraphobia: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The fear of going out into public places. It can occur with or without panic attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I once read a book based on all the different phobias that have been diagnosed by psychologists. When I read this word I thought to myself &amp;quot;wow... how can these people go on living their lives like this?&amp;quot; I just can't imagine.&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I agree about the slant toward complexity. Some of the best words are indeed commonplace, and this is a good list of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chestershire is Cheshire. You're thinking of Worcestershire, which is pronounced Worster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Fun assignment!&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here are mine:&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kerf&lt;/span&gt; - a slit or notch made by a saw or cutting torch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;naff&lt;/span&gt; - unstylish, clichéd, or outmoded. 2: to fool around or go about. Naff off - rude imperative. There used to be a UK clothing brand by the name of Naf Naf, not sure if there was a connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;gribble&lt;/span&gt; - a small marine isopod crustacean that destroys submerged timber. I love this word, and the fact that there is a lifeform whose sole purpose is to destroy submerged timber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;wallydrag&lt;/span&gt; - a feeble, dwarfed animal or person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;craven&lt;/span&gt; - If you were frustrated by a person's cowardly ways, you might want to use the adjective craven to describe their actions. Like this as it's so similar to brazen, which means the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;halcyon&lt;/span&gt; - Something that is halcyon is calm, peaceful, or tranquil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;polyglot&lt;/span&gt; - Someone who is able to speak, write, or read several languages is a polyglot. Again, fun to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;aegis&lt;/span&gt; -To act under the aegis of someone is to act with their protection, support, or guardianship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;philistine&lt;/span&gt; - A philistine is a person who is disdainful of intellectual or artistic pursuits. A word that sounds like what it describes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;bon vivant&lt;/span&gt;- A bon vivant is a person who is devoted to the finer things in life, especially good food and drink. And usually fun to hang out with! </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Halcyon is the title of a song from the mortal kombat soundtrack and it matches that description very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also the name of these super powered balls of elemental destruction in final fantasy video games. Peaceful, unless you are near them, then it is death and maiming and resetting the game. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Potamophilious is more amusing than pretty, sharing a root with hippopotamus. Makes me think of Fantasia and the dancing, tutu-wearing hippo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peregrination is particularly nice, though, for a similar animal-related reason. Falcons are just prettier than hippos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble with these words is they're all Latinate or Greek in origin. :( What's wrong with a good Anglo-Saxon word every now and then? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Some nice imagery in these. I wonder about this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----&lt;br /&gt;| It's as if, to you, that being alive is a prank that you’re playing on the world.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not actually correct, gramatically speaking. It should be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----&lt;br /&gt;| It's as though -- to you -- being alive is a prank that you’re playing on the world.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I made about four changes. But it's an excellent image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's look at yours:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ Yours ]&lt;br /&gt;| It's like when you’re driving a car and you’re caught in between gears. You’re going too fast for the gear that you’re in, but not fast enough for the next, and while you decide to speed up or slow down, your car is jerking around and everything is going to hell trying to keep in motion.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about a bit of tightening:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ My alternate ]&lt;br /&gt;| You're driving, and the car is caught between gears: too fast to gear down, not fast enough for the next notch. And while you vacillate here, the car jerks and shudders as it tries to keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two words are an idiom, so the -ing is OK. But otherwise, avoid -ing and avoid all kinds of verb phrases. This is another way of saying (to everyone): Stop reading Neil Gaiman. Almost nothing in that contemporary genre approaches good writing. Good stories, perhaps, but not good writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I actually don't know if you're a Gaiman fan; but he is not a master of the form.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot;So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; the high-water mark — that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; -Hunter S.

                <MESSAGE> Some good ones. Thompson was always a bit loose. His would be better like so:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, less than five years later, looking west from the steep hill in Las Vegas, one can almost see the high-water mark — that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always look for the extra words. Try to remove them.

                <MESSAGE>Shelley is dependably craft-oriented. See his essay on the voluntary suspension of disbelief; it's one of th emost important essays in all of English literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's look at your sentence. Good imagery and vocabulary. Try to pare it down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ Yours ]&lt;br /&gt;| As the cold, heavy rain harshly touched their pale faces, it glided off with such ease that it wasn’t even noticeable after a while.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ Mine ]&lt;br /&gt;| The hard rain coursed down their faces, pale in the dwindling day. But the water slid off, and away, and they did not notice it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I've made it longer! But it's also tighter, and it says more. Somehow the sentence seemed to need a reminder of the time of day, which I added. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rule of adjectives is: never more than two in a single phrase (your first phrase has four). </MESSAGE>

Is is karaoke of an Elvis song, or is someone singing like Elvis? If it's the latter, try this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ Alternate 2 ]&lt;br /&gt;| They wept and clutched each other. They rocked back and forth as the man on stage -- sounding all the world like Elvis back from the dead -- sung karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's more clear. Still clunky, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,----[ Alternate 3 ]&lt;br /&gt;| It was as though Elvis stood on stage, crooning into the karaoke machine. [A] and [B] wept and clutched one another. They rocked back and forth to that sweet, sickly music.&lt;br /&gt;`----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better. Each other is for multiple persons; one another is for two people. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>John Donne was an interesting character. Always mystical, and quite ahead of his time.

Now, to your sentence:

,----[ Yours ]
| Adrenaline is the rush in life that causes your body to act,
| ignoring the cautions of your mind.
`----

Try to focus on small details, small words that make a large difference. Also, pay attention to the order of your words. Like so:

,----[ Mine ]
| In the rush of adrenaline, the body acts. The cautions of the mind are ignored.
`----

,----[ Or... ]
| The rush of adrenaline spurs the body to act and ignores the cautions of the mind.
`----

Try to avoid using &quot;you&quot;.

                <MESSAGE>Salamander is excellent. A very creative and interesting book. Beats Gaiman by a long shot (I'm on an anti-Gaiman rant, sort of, this morning...).

And King is reliably interesting also. Sometimes he can be surprisingly literary, given the reputation and genre of his work. He is, actually, one of my favorites: not for craft (that would be Merwin) but for dependable storytelling.

Now, to your sentence:

,----[ Original ]
| 
| Their mouths full of moisture join together sparking unified
| sensations of a sweet addiction.
`----

Quite a bit here. The trick it to tease it all out:

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| Their moist mouths join together, sparking, unified
| as a sweet addiction.
`----

Still not quite right. Perhaps it should be two sentences:

,----[ Alternate 2]
| 
| Their moist mouths join together. Sparking, unified,
| a sweet addiction.
`----

Tight, good, perhaps a bit too tight. But overall, an improvement I think (see the McCarthy excerpt from The Road in the readings for this week to get a sense of tight and too tight and how this can still work well).

| I don't know what home looks like yet, but he takes me there. 
`----

That's very nicely done. The middle part, with the comma and the word &quot;but,&quot; is slightly clunky, the but the sentiment of the sentence carries us through. It might be possible to clean it up a bit, like so:

,----[ Alternate ]
| I do not know what home looks like yet. And yet, he takes me there. 
`----

The comma/but structure is inherently unstable, although at times essential. So, don't avoid it altogether, just be really sure that you can't say it any other way.

Your poem snippet sounds like a Borges vignette. Have you read The Library of Babel? (It's in labyrinths):

&quot;I cannot think it unlikely that there is such a total book on some shelf in the universe. I pray to the unknown gods that some man -- even a single man, tens of centuries ago -- has perused and read this book. If the honor and wisdom and joy of such a reading are not to be my own, then let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my own place may be in hell. Let me be tortured and battered and annihilated, but let there be one instant, one creature, wherein thy enormous Library may find its justification.&quot;

&lt;p&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbot.  Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.  (Tolkien, &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentence 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't need to touch my face to know there are now beads of sweat slipping off my forehead, flicking off my eyelids, streaming down the back of my neck. (Mark Z. Danielewski, &lt;em&gt;House of Leaves&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>Tolkien is reliably craft-oriented with sentences, except when he forgets that he is no longer living in the twelfth century...

I like your sentence. It's quite expressive.

,----[ Original ]
| The tree was massive, fifty feet from the tip to where the roots
| broke through the soil. The ancient evergreen had been a constant
| reminder to any who stopped to notice and it said, &quot;I am forever
| and you alone are nothing.&quot;
`----


I wonder if we could tweak it a bit:

,----[ Alternate ]
| The massive tree stood fifty feet or more in height, from its
| slender tip to where rough roots broke through the soil. This
| ancient evergreen, this sentinel, was a reminder, to all who
| passed, of the paucity of human life.

Try to avoid absolutes of all kinds: forever, never, always, and so on. Try instead to offer the quality of something in comparison to another thing: Emacs outshines all other editors the way the noonday sun obliterates the stars.

By the time school's over and I've got a job, house, man, etc., I'm at least going to be over thirty. The way she's worded that sentence makes me think: well good. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;More&lt;/span&gt; than fifty percent of women over 30 are having babies...I don't feel so left out after all.

                <MESSAGE>Kesey is good. I like the choice you made. Very expressive and clear.

In the second sentence, &quot;per cent&quot; can also be written &quot;percent&quot; (which, I think, is tighter). And, although the sentence is interesting, &quot;having babies&quot; is quite awkward. But I can see why you chose it (for the idea).

Now, to yours:

,----[ Yours ]
| Piles of snow surrounded the yard and sparkled in the sun.
`----

Overall it's quite good. But I think the language could be spruced up a bit:

,----[ Alternate ]
| Hillocks (clumps, smatterings, disconsolate heaps, gossamer
| sweeps, etc.) of (fresh, new, old, etc.) snow surrounded the yard
| and sparkled in the sun.
`----

So:

,----
| Small, shimmering drifts of new snow surrounded the yard and sparkled in the sun.

                <MESSAGE>Some good sentences here, both from you and others. Much variety, rhythm, and clarity. Let's look at one of yours more closely:

,----[ Original ]
| 
| I don't really know why we drank, one of us always ended up
| puking and feeling like shit every time -- it was usually Sonja.
`----

OK, so you are saying about four things in this sentence. It's about what you do know (why you drank -- yes, of course you know why, and if you don't you can't write about it); it's about consequences, and youth; and it's about friendship and vulnerability. That's a lot of material for one sentence. Do-able, but tough. Let's try to winnow it down a bit (never use the words *really* and *always* -- see my post to Dave):

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| I don't know why we drank: boredom, youth, desperation, all of it
| wrapped up and simmering. But when we did, Sonja got sick. She
| would weave, and halt, and heave, and cry, and sometimes laugh.
| But the laughter was dark, somehow.
`----

Or something like that (I'm changing a whole bunch of stuff here, but you get the idea).

Read Scott Russell Sanders' essay about his father's alcoholism, Under the Influence:

My father drank. He drank as a gut-punched boxer gasps for breath, as a starving dog gobbles food--compulsively, secretly, in pain and trembling. I use the past tense not because he ever quit drinking but because he quit living. That is how the story ends for my father, age sixty-four, heart bursting, body cooling, slumped and forsaken on the linoleum of my brother's trailer. The story continues for my brother, my sister, my mother, and me, and will continue as long as memory holds.

In the perennial present of memory, I slip into the garage or barn to see my father tipping back the flat green bottles of wine, the brown cylinders of whiskey, the cans of beer disguised in paper bags. His Adam's apple bobs, the liquid gurgles, he wipes the sandy-haired back of a hand over his lips, and then, his bloodshot gaze bumping into me, he stashes the bottle or can inside his jacket, under the workbench, between two bales of hay, and we both pretend the moment has not occurred.

...

The above passage is one of the finest two paragraphs of literature in English in the last 100 years.

                <MESSAGE>There are a few items that could improve the sentence from Twilight (reducing the looseness and verbal cruft):

,----[ Alternate ]
| The door opened again, and cold wind swept through the room. The
| papers on the desk rustled, swirled in my hair, ghosted past my
| face.
`----

Much better.

The Rowling sentence is not bad.

Now, to yours. Good expressiveness -- but why the dash? Careful with dashes. They can be very useful but also easily mixed up with other types of items. Use the dash to set off a complementary point -- like this one -- from the main body of a sentence. Try not to use the dash to precede a clause that ends a sentence (well, you can, but it's tough to do well). 

Also, how do we know that Matthew already cares for someone when he hasn't even been on a first date with them yet? 

,----[ Yours ]
| 
| First dates always made Matthew nervous - the sweaty palms,
| nervous laughter and shaky hands were unavoidable when it came to
| being with someone he cared for.
`----

How 'bout simplifying this a bit:

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| First dates made Matthew nervous: sweaty palms,
| nervous laughter, shaky hands.
`----

This is more clear and precise. You can get to the caring later.

                <MESSAGE>The Kennedy sentence is quite expressive and also a good example of the fact that many authors today do not receive good editing services. The sentence could really be much cleaner and tighter:

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| The blood ran to his wrist, gathered, then fell to the quarry
| tiles below. The large drops splashed on the tiles. Haloed around
| each one was a tiny flare of threads, of starring.
`----

Now, to yours:

,----[ Original ]
| 
| I slowly shuffle counterclockwise around the edge of the room,
| critiquing the shoddy artwork and miserable poems stapled to the
| wall.
`----

Let me ask you this: is this a sentence about you judging others, or about your own judgement of your judgmentalism? It's an important question. Are you really critiquing yourself here? If you are, you should say so. Also, critiquing is something that has an outcome: words, thoughts, whatever. That might be in the sentence also. So, let's try an alternate:

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| I shuffle around the perimeter of the room, absorbing the artwork
| and poems stapled to the walls. I wonder about the motivations in
| each of the pieces: their driftlessness, or desparation, or
| wonder. I ask myself if these pieces, scattered and fragmented as
| they are, might be reflections of my own travail.
`----

Or something like that. Writing is always personal. What we see is always us. We are the world.

                <MESSAGE>OK, you know I don't particularly like Gaiman, but that sentence is not bad. The last &quot;the&quot; is redundant, as is the penultimate one and the one before that (should be &quot;... the safety of light for chill certainties of darkness&quot;); but overall, it's quite good. 

And, of course, the dog sentence in quirky and somehow quite good also. Awful and engaging.

Now to yours:

,----
| eat me, hissed the apple.
`----

It seems to say what you want. Good. But you could switch the order, so that we hear the hissing before we read the words that are hissed (and this would be better):

,----[ Alternate ]
| 
| The apple hissed: &quot;eat me.&quot;
`----

This makes the sentence non-poetry but also more precise and clear.
Both versions are good.

From:
http://www.writerswrite.com/wblog.php?wblog=203091

&quot;Both Rowling and Meyer, they're speaking directly to young people... The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good.&quot;

...

&quot;People are attracted by the stories, by the pace, and in the case of Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual.&quot; 

...

&quot;A lot of the physical side of it is conveyed in things like, the vampire will touch her forearm or run a hand over skin, and she just flushes all hot and cold. And for girls, that's a shorthand for all the feelings that they're not ready to deal with yet.&quot;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Oooooo, that's interesting. What do you think of Rowling? I read the Potter series and thought it was great. I didn't think Rowling's first book in the series was especially well-written, compared to her follow-ups (not sure if that book was her 'warm-up', or if she had a team of writers and editors for the rest, or how it all works at that level).&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to give King another shot. As mentioned in a previous post, I don't like reading his stuff because, well, it freaks me out. But somebody had recommended one of his books to me. Can't remember the name of it but it has something to do with a virus wiping out the world's population and the survivors living in either Vegas or Colorado...&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Rebecca try the new King book LIsey's Story it's not as scary or bad as a lot of his other books. There is one part that involves a can open that is quite disturbing but I would say that's the worst of it. It's more about a writer who fell in love with a woman that wasn't scared of where he came from and stayed through all the bad. It was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about Stephanie Meyer I did think her writing was horrible. I began Twilight and wasn't sure if I was going to be able to read the book because I didn't like how she wrote. But I got past her writing and focused on the story which I enjoyed and couldn't get enough of of. However being older than the intended age category for the book I did feel cheated on some of the more heavier scenes where sexual stuff was involved and that Meyer ripped me off. Overall I liked the story not the writer.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I think that Rowling is, in general, pretty good. King is much better -- but you have to find a King book that doesn't freak you out and wasn't written while he was drinking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different Seasons&lt;br /&gt;Four Past Midnight&lt;br /&gt;The Green Mile&lt;br /&gt;Duma Key&lt;br /&gt;Hearts in Atlantis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stand is the post-apocalyptic book. Excellent craft, but creepy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that King is good, but not great. He is middling in terms of quality. For novelistic expertise with mass appeal, look at Henry Porter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I've never been a huge King fan, but The Green Mile is one of my favourite novels because it is so well detailed and beautifully crafted. I've tried reading a couple other of his books but I just can't get through them because Green Mile set the bar really high for me. Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption was part of Different Seasons, right? I'm going to try and give that one a shot. It seems I prefer his work when he's not trying to be really scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it was Rebecca who asked about Rowling, right? I've read the Harry Potter series, and I wasn't impressed with her writing until the fifth and sixth books. I commend her for being able to create a wonderful series that's amazingly imaginative, but I found the first four books quite sloppilly written. But I thankfully stuck with the series, and thought that Phoenix and Half-Blook Prince were her best. In those two books especially, I think what intrigued me the most was that she was able to create much stronger imagery. Either way, the series overall was an okay read, but there's evidence of really good writing in the latter books that make me a fan.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I just recently finished reading Lisey's Story by Stephen King. This book is a typical twisted Stephen King novel. I found that Lisey's Story started of slower than other Stephen King novels I have read. I sat there reading the first quarter of the book knowing and waiting in anticipation for the thrill to start. Sure enough the twists kept coming and coming. This story is a love story about a couple who save each other over and over even after death does them part. Lisey's Story tells a compelling story of a writer and his fishing pool. I believe that anyone who is really interested in pursuing writing should read this book and experience this place beyond reality that Stephen King has created. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I currently have three books on the go, which is probably not the most productive of reading habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Books v. Cigarettes&lt;/span&gt;, a collection of essays by George Orwell. The essays are not related in any way, save for having the same author. The title essay is especially fun to read, as Orwell goes through a lengthy process of figuring out whether he spends more money on books or cigarettes, and the lasting value of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/span&gt; by Ayn Rand. I’ve been reading this off and on for a few months now, and how people are able to finish this without putting it down for a few weeks is beyond me. The book itself is just huge, and while I do enjoy reading it, I find that it tends to drag on at certain parts, hence why I put it down for a while at a time. I’m only about halfway through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third book is&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; Bang Crunch&lt;/span&gt; by Neil Smith, a collection of random and quirky short stories. I’m reading this as part of another creative writing class, and it’s quite a fun read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I also just finished re-reading the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Watchmen&lt;/span&gt; graphic novel, which I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. It is definitely one of the smartest comic books to date, and challenges all of the stereotypes surrounding the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I bought &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Watchmen&lt;/span&gt; a few months ago and I read in two days because I couldn't put it down. I can't believe how intelligent and layered a comic-book can actually be. I loved the other pirate comic book sub-plot within the actually story! Did you know it was on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt;'s top novels from the past 100 years? Hopefully they won't screw it up with the film adaptation. (They will, but I'm going to see it anyways) </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I'm not sure what to expect from the film. There's no way that they can fit everything into a three hour slot (apparently the pirate comic will be an animated feature released on DVD beforehand), so it'll be interesting to see what changes are made. Apparently they got rid of the 'alien'.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I just recently finished reading D.H. Lawrence's &amp;quot;The Rainbow&amp;quot; for one of my classes, which is an interesting study both of British modernism and different generations of a family. I thought that the book provided a fascinating look at how a family changes over time, from the Grandparents to the Grandchildren. However, the book was difficult to get through - it was extremely long, and I had a difficult time relating to and even liking the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently reading &amp;quot;Sense and Sensibility&amp;quot; by Jane Austen again, which I had previously rejected as dull and predictable. However, now that I've picked it up again, there is a new magic to the words, to the story, and to Jane Austen's wit. Her work was in some ways entirely contradictory to the values of her time, and is a response to some of the social problems that women faced in the nineteenth century. I'm enjoying it overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also reading a poetry collection by Anne Compton, called &amp;quot;Processional&amp;quot;. The poetry is somewhat difficult to get through, especially since the beginning section was very predictably &amp;quot;Canadian&amp;quot;, opening with descriptions of the seasons and nature. But the poems are getting better as I am going along, so I think in the end I'll end up liking the overall work.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Your comments regarding 'The Rainbow' and 'Sense and Sensibility' make me think of the books that they make you read in school, and how it totally kills what may have otherwise been great reads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because most teachers require some sort of assignment using the book, I've found that it just turns people off from the book entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happened to me while reading 'The Catcher in the Rye', I didn't really enjoy the book during English 10 (or 11?) because we spent weeks doing stupid exercises and tests on it. I've read the book several times since and have grown to love it, which kind of makes it seem like school was keeping me from truly enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You know, I actually find that when I read something for school, it makes me a lot more interested in the work. Listening to other people's opinions on the characters, and hearing a lot more about the background of both the author and the work itself is really illuminating for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if I loathe the book entirely, then studying it for two to three weeks is just the worst. &lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>I have to agree with both of you. It does make it cool to hear other peoples' opinions and such about a book rather than just reading it yourself.

But Chris, I have always thought along the same lines as you. Out of all the books I was made to read in elem and seconday, I only liked one of them. The rest I felt too pressured to read, and if you didn't &quot;See&quot; what the others saw you felt like you were going to get a bad mark. 

There is something about forced reading that I didn't like, I don't know why.

If you were wondering which book I liked, I like &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I never had to read that one, and trust me, I did my share of poets and romance. LOL. About five shakespeare plays. Ugh, my least favourite thing to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're right Gillian. I found in HS that a lot of time was spent on one genre during each year and just a sprinkling of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other books I did have to read included Brave New World, The Outsiders (which I always get chastized for hating lol), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest and that is about all I can remember right now lol.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE> Oh, I liked Lord of the Flies (kill the pig, slit her throat, bash her in). I think it was because I liked the teacher. Well, more than liked, had a massive crush on. I was not so fond, however, of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Red Badge of Courage&lt;/span&gt;. There's only so much a crush can do, and making me like Stephen Crane is not one of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've both loved and hated having to read books for classes. I also, through chance and acceleration, missed some of the standard American education system reads, most notably &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A Catcher in the Rye&lt;/span&gt;. To this day, I've not read it. I read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;1984&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/span&gt; for pleasure, having missed reading them in school. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my senior year, my Brit lit teacher gave us choices for some of the books we read, so I did &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Andromeda Strain&lt;/span&gt;. She was quite the interesting character, though. Dr. Antoine looked like a friendly little troll, complete with a whiskery chin, and this added to the effect when she stood up in front of us and recited Beowulf in the original Olde English. I didn't like anything historically prior to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;King Lear&lt;/span&gt;, but she made things memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the standard run-of-the-mill teacher can wreck any book, no matter how good. I barely remember anything I read my first two years of high school, and don't recall liking any of it. Ms. Newman, who was 300 pounds or so, called me Tiffany all 4 years of high school, always had her hand in a bag of chips, and graded us by having us write our grades on a sheet of paper and performing some sort of mental voodoo on the figures, did not instill in me a love of literature.&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> You are so right about that, Tierney. Teachers, especially during the elementary and middle school years, have so much power to either inspire the mind or squash it (your Ms. Newman story was hilarious).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I had excellent teachers in elementary school who encouraged reading, and made it fun. Plus, since my parents decided to get rid of the television for a few years, there wasn't a lot to do at home on cold and rainy days BUT read. Outside of the required grade school readings, I also remember reading the James Herriot series (All Creatures Great and Small), The Famous Five, Nancy Drew, and - this is so 80s teenage trash - Choose Your Own Adventure and, erm, Sweet Valley High.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a rotton middle school where teachers either didn't care or they did care but couldn't control the class. Not only was the school was really rough, but it was also overcrowded so many of the classes were held in old, musty portables. I remember during one of my English classes there was one kid named Kevin who chucked a metal throwing star around the portable while the teacher was there (her tactic was &amp;quot;to ignore it&amp;quot;). I was pretty horrified by people in general during these years so Lord of the Flies wasn't a good reading escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We moved away right before I went to high school and it was such a relief to be able to be in a new school system and learn in a normal environment.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>In spite of the fact that I grudgingly picked up some of the books from the list of required readings, I'm actually enjoying one of them. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Walden &lt;/span&gt;by Henry David Thoreau is a damn fine book. At the root, it's about Thoreau's years spent living in a log cabin (that he built) and the chronicles of his self-sufficiency. Layered on top of that are his rich insights into life and his criticisms of consumerism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My favorite lines so far are: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or any country risen to the dignity of an art,&amp;quot; and &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;When the soldier is hit by a cannon-ball, rags are as becoming as purple.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's lines like these that really express his view that simplicity is purity, and I love it even though it makes me feel like a consumer whore. I honestly can't believe how relevant and addictive this book is. I'm going to have to re-read it at least a few times to really appreciate it. Thanks for pointing this book out Ross, it's steadily rising into my top ten list. If you don't get any posts from me for a while it's because I've gone to grow a beard and live in the woods until I've started to figure life out. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>This morning I was working on a piece on my OLPC and missed my stop, but I've started rereading &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Writing Down the Bones.&lt;/span&gt; I've loved Natalie Goldberg's books for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may also reread &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt;. I still have my old masking-taped copy from high school. I turned down the corners of many of the pages. I identified very deeply with Phaedrus back then. I possibly still do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the reading list was one big stroll down memory lane. I read many of these authors in high school; Annie Dillard was a huge influence on me. I read and reread &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&lt;/span&gt;. The story in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;An American Childhood &lt;/span&gt;of her getting her microscope will always be dear to me. I read it my junior year. It described what my childhood had lacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I have been accumulating more books than I can possibly read right now. :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>If your a girl who has loved and lost or have had to fight for a guy then read Twilight. It's a very good love story. Some girls in my IDEAs class tend to thing the book plays to falling in love, getting married, and pregnant to young children. I tend to disagree perhaps that's because I am old enough to separate the age of the main character and relate the book to myself at my age. Either way I don't believe the age of the main character Bella is relevant or takes away from the basic fact that this is a love story. Thankfully after reading the whole series I was also not disappointed in the ending and was left quite satisfied that the series was over. I recommend reading Twilight if your a sucker for cutsy love stories. I promise you wont be able to put the first one down let alone the rest of the series. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I do enjoy the Twilight books...but only if I'm in the mood to completely turn off my brain. I find that the book, at least for the target audience, projects a lot of negative stereotypes, especially about love and romance. Essentially, all of Bella's romantic relationships in the book are abusive in some way! To give these books to a 15 year old girl would be, in my opinion, more damaging than anything. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ya but think about what is really happening. Bella is a prone to getting herself into to trouble and Edward does not know what getting hurt means cause he's pretty much invinsible. Edward is only trying to keep her safe and when she becomes a vampire like him she no longer has Edward so worried. So is that really being in an abusive relationship or a caring relationship. He has the power to save her from getting hurt and does not want his love to get hurt so why not do what you can to keep her safe. A lot of the time Bella gets herself in to trouble on purpose it seems because she wants Edward to turn her faster and if she keeps pushing near death he will eventually have no choice. So is Bella purposely putting herself in a relationship that may seem abusive to some or is she trying to be manipulative?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sisters are 13, 14, and 17 and I have talked to them about the book and don't find reasons for them to not read the book. I guess they just have the common sense to understand this is make believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark kent in Smallville is overprotective with his friends who get themselves into trouble. His relationship with Lana is also very overprotective yet I don't believe people would consider superman to be in the abusive category in relationships.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

I actually watched the film before I started reading the book and I'm absolutely blown away by the amount of detail that was lost in the film, although the film wasn't too bad for a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both Twilight and New Moon but I haven't been about to get really into Twilight yet... I found it a bit slow in the first could of chapters, does it pick up at all?&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Wow! I have missed quite the discussion. LOL!

So first off, yes, I recommend Twilight if you want fluffy, teenage angst, unrealistic love stories. It is a good read, as it was said, if you want to turn off your brain.

I will give Stephanie Meyer credit in the imagery department. She is incredibly descriptive, I was able to picture everything that she was describing and, in that sense I think the movie did a good job.

The movie, of course, misses a lot of stuff. But being that the book is from Bella's POV, it is hard to have all of her side thoughts mentioned out loud. And they can't have a movie with all voice over. 

I agree that it all depends on the reader, I know a 12-year-old that  read them and just enjoyed them as a book. I believe too, that it is up to the parents to tell the children that the book is make-believe if they become too enthralled. Or if they start to believe everything that is said in the book. 

But from my experience, most girls don't find her relationship with Edward as abusive. They just love his attentiveness, his looks, his smirk, you can't forget that smirk, (Can you tell that I too want an Edward of my own? hahaha  Just kidding.)

Caprice, I find they do pick up. I don't want to give to much away, but when the three bad vamps (james, laurent and victoria) come into it and James starts to go mental for Bella, it gets better. Especially when they are in Florida. And that is all I can really say without giving away the action.

As for Cuckoo's Nest, I too am blown away at what the film cut out. Even simple little things that would have added so much were cut out, for what? Time? Budget? Either way they shouldn't have been cut. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I agree...Stephenie Meyer has taken the traditional &amp;quot;Vampire&amp;quot; story and put some really interesting twists in it...I enjoy fantasy books, and on that level I did enjoy Twilight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just found that in all of Bella's relationships, the only thing that she wanted was to be with the guy. She has no meaningful friendships outside of her relationships with Edward and Jacob, and is constantly reacting to their actions. Edward and Jacob are both controlling characters in some ways, and she doesn't seem to have any other goals, other than being with them and making both of them happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it also does depend on the person who is reading the book...some girls have a lot of common sense when they're younger; I just think that in some ways the way that Bella's relationships are in the book isn't something that the average 15 year old should aspire to have. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> My last couple of courses were heavy on textbook reading so I had to put my pleasure-reading aside for a few months. It's so nice to be able to pick it up again, and for a course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished reading Three Day Road. My husband recommended it, even though I'm not really one for prison or war-based themes. This book was fantastic. It was about two young Cree who are fighting in the trenches of WWI as snipers, relying on the hunting and shooting skills they learned while growing up in the bush near James Bay.&lt;br /&gt;The book was really well-researched and well-written an, impressively, it was Boyden's debut novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm currently reading Graham Greene's satirical spy book called Our Man in Havana. Really enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to tracking some of the books down on the recommended reading list of this class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm currently reading &amp;quot;Simple Recipes&amp;quot; by Madeleine Thien and &amp;quot;Science and Human Values&amp;quot; by J. Bronowski. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Simple Recipes&amp;quot; is about love, family, history and self. In the story, a young girl learns from her father the simple art of making rice. It is a ritual father and daughter can perform together, preparing the evening meal, savoring the tastes and smells of a faraway homeland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For &amp;quot;Science and Human Values&amp;quot;, Bronowski said, &amp;quot;It is often said that science has destroyed our values and put nothing in its place. What has really happened of course is that science has shown in harsh relief the division between our values and our world.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other books are mostly text book. I have start on the Foucault's &amp;quot;The history of sexuality&amp;quot;. It is very interesting of how it talks about power and relationship in some point.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Edmond,

I completely agree with the quote. Science obviously can't destroy values because old ones still exist and people follow them.

Anything else you can say about this book? It sounds like a nice read. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading &amp;quot;The Triumph of Katie Byrne&amp;quot; by Barbara Taylor Bradford. I just started reading it last night, and so far it's definitely a good read :) I also want to read &amp;quot;Twilight&amp;quot;. When I'm with my friends, they're always discussing how great the book is, and I always feel so out of the loop, so &amp;quot;Twilight&amp;quot; will definitely be the next book I read. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>That is cook Amanjit! If you want to get some more info in Twilight there is a great discussion going in my thread about it. I don't think too much of the plot has been given away, but just so you know.

What is the Triumph book you're reading about?</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hi Chantelle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to your question, &amp;quot;The Triumph of Katie Byrne&amp;quot; is about a highschool girl trying to make it big on Broadway, but she goes through a lot of triumphs and ordeals that prevent her from getting to the place where she wants to be. I'm only on Chapter 5, but so far, so good! &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;As far as books goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for another Creative Writing class... I definitely feel that the book captures a lot more of the detail and descriptions that the film failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book that I'm reading (purely for entertainment purposes) is Tucker Max's book &amp;quot;I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.&amp;quot; I have been a fan of his blog for quite a number of years, and when I first found out that he had released a book, I immediately ran to Chapters to purchase it. If you are ever in need of a good laugh, I suggest you pick up this book or at least read his blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I'm reading a lot of newspapers and magazines :)&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

That Max book does sound quiet interesting. Where did you find his blog? I'd like to check it out.

                <MESSAGE>On top of the books that I'm reading for my classes, I am also working on getting through Larry Wilmore's &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I'd Rather We Got Casinos (and Other Black Thoughts)&lt;/span&gt;. I know Wilmore as the Senior Black Correspondent on The Daily Show, as well as his work on The Office, so when I found out that he wrote a book, I knew that his writing would be a good, and so far I'm impressed. I can't wait to get further into it, and if this forum's here when I finish it, I'll let you know how it is. But if you're looking for some laughs and a some interesting insight, this is a pretty good book to check out. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;&gt; In the past three years I have been told to read many different pieces of literature, from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Iliad&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Gunslinger&lt;/span&gt;. Most were pieces of classical literature for my many classical literature courses. This month I made a stand. I'm rereading the series &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;A song if Ice and Fire&lt;/span&gt; by George R.R. Martin. It is a basic medieval fiction full of plot twists, back-stabbing, intrigue and war. It cannot hold a candle to most literary masterpieces... but it inspires emotion in me when I read it and that's very important to me.&lt;br /&gt; I'm also reading many different Medieval Fencing documents written in and around the 18th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...I just finished reading &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cowboys Are My Weakness&lt;/span&gt; By Pam Houston. It was actually on another book list for my CRWR 2300 class. I had to choose one fiction book, out of several: read it, and then compare the techniques in writing to my own writing. The book was actually really good. It was all short stories capturing the essence of the old heterosexual blues. Apparently the writer used to be a wilderness guide and many of her stories take place in Alaska, the Arctic, and the Colorado countryside. I found this book to be brilliantly written. Her voice is edgy, witty, funny, descriptive -- yet to the point. Things that, I as a reader look for in a good book. Most of the stories were anywhere from five pages to thirty pages. If any of you plan to check this one out; a few of my favourites were &amp;quot;Selway&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Highwater&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;In My Next Life&amp;quot;. The last story in the book, &amp;quot;In My Next Life&amp;quot; actually made me cry. It was so full of emotion and heartbreak; and it really affected me. Gotta love when stories can do that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also just finished reading &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Road&lt;/span&gt; by Cormac McCarthy (hope I spelled that right). I actually read it for a book club. I'm not in an &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; book club, it's mainly just me, my mom and a few of her friends. My Mom and I really enjoyed the book...however, her friends did not. When we met up last week to discuss it they all had completely different opinions (hey, at least it makes it interesting, right?). I thought the main theme was hope, whereas they felt it was hopelessness. The book was kind of a post-apocalyptic thriller about a man and his son trying to survive and to find, what they called &amp;quot;the light&amp;quot; (since this term wasn't completely defined in the novel, I think it meant a few things: people who weren't cannibals (this may confuse you but I can't really explain it to you unless you read the book), electricity, hope, comfort, normality, etc). It was a very dark novel and I think maybe that's why some of the women in the club didn't really enjoy it the way I did. I heard that this book was made into a movie, but for some reason, wasn't released. Anyone know anything about this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started to read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt; by Robert M. Pirsig. It's one of the many books I choose from Ross's list. I can't really comment too much on it right now as I'm only about ten pages in. It's interesting enough to keep my attention though...so far...&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I abuse my library privileges. Here's a bit of what I'm reading this week-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hand by Frank Wilson &lt;br /&gt;-this book is distracting me from anything I do with my hands, including typing. the word count has decreased and we'll not go into the spelling mistakes right now. a good read, the anecdotes are brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The World without Us by Alan Weisman&lt;br /&gt;-humanity gone, just poof into nothing. mildly heartwarming in a disturbing fashion, since without us, the earth will be fine. the bits about giant mammals and ancient forests were intriguing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and a complete bit of fluff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose and The Beast by Francesca Block. fairy tales, wonderfully warped ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I do the same thing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And it's still cheaper than buying them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you ever check out books.google.com ? A lot of the books are only limited preview, but I still enjoy reading what's there, and can decide whether I want to get the book and find out more.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I just started reading the book &amp;quot;Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything&amp;quot; by Steven Levitt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't really read a lot of it, but the chapters are divided into different topics. I decided to start at Chapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children. So far it's really good. There are some seriously surprising facts so far. Part of the chapter talks about names, and how they can predict a persons role in society. It says that people named 'Jamil' are far less likely to have a larger income than someone, for example, named 'Mark.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a very fast reader, but iIm working away at it, slowly but surely...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to reading Chapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, i'd recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> This is a great book.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I'd find so much enjoyment in reading a book on economics, but Dubner manages to present them in an irresistibly entertaining way.&lt;br /&gt;If you're still interested in his stuff when you're done the book, check out his blog at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;Times.&lt;/a&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>My Little World&lt;br /&gt;By Edmond Au&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ownership can be see as the state of some individual's exclusive rights and control over something such as property, right and object. As a person is gaining ownership of things, not only his life will be changed, but also his values and character will be influenced as well. Indeed, I find that i am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to own an apartment, to live on my own and to get my &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; freedom without my parents limitations. My apartment is my little world. I have the control on everything in my little world without anyone interfering with my decisions. This ownership changes my characters to be more independent, confident and responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first change to my character after I moved in my apartment is that I could no longer be relied and depended on anyone but myself only. Meanwhile, I had to transform myself from a dependent teenager to be a grown, independent man. The process of the transformation was bitter sweet. However, I manage to overcome the obstacles day by day. I still remembered the first night when I was staying alone in my apartment; I could not fall into asleep. It was not because that I was not tired, but I felt insecure and uncomfortable stay in this place that have no connection with me. From time to time, I would add on few pieces of decoration and furniture so that I do feel the growth of my ownership in this place. Sometime, I would invite friends came over for parties and build up more memories along the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Subsequently, my self-confidence was building up as I was being more outgoing and independent. I did remember when I was in kindergarden; I would not hang out and make friends with any of my classmates. Besides, I would isolate myself from the outer world and stay home in my bedroom with my favorite toys and games. As I grew older, I got more self-confidence by joining boy scout. But still, I did not know how to express myself and share my feelings and thoughts with the others. For all that, I found out that my traditional parents were part of the cause of the communication and social problem. Chinese parents sometimes gave too much protections and restrictions to their children, that it discouraging their children to learn through personal experiences and failure. However, after I moved out and being more independent, I learned how to talk and present myself with confidence. I would not hesitate to express my self and ideas that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eventually, I was being more responsible to things that were directly or indirectly related to myself. In the past, I would depend only on my parents for everything and took it as granted. Now, I would do chores, grocery shipping, and payments. Meanwhile, I earned how to organize tasks, do time management, and be more multitask. Sometimes, I would even help out my neighbors taking care of their dogs. Thus, I built up a habit of being responsible on different tasks. If I was not ready to take the task, I would rather refuse to take it instead of doing a mediocre job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Eighteen years of suppression and three years of transformation, I do not only get the ownership of my apartment, but also I do encounter a change to my characters. I am now an independent and responsible person with self confidence. Hence, I do no longer depend on anyone, influence easily by random comments, and being irresponsible. I am looking forward to more changes and challenges in my life, and maybe eventually I can find out more about myself along the way. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I couldn't agree with you more Edmond. Although I haven't yet moved from home, I already can picture myself feeling like you did. I want to be independent, but am afraid to be in a place that is all my own, new and unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like your idea that it is a transformation. I mean, for most people, it can't just happen over night. It might take a week, a month, a year or more, but it will take time for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>I like that this piece captured that moving out is not just about freedom, it is also and probably more so about responsiblity. I think restrictions of parents are almost comforting, because you know what you can and cannot do.. but when you live on your own the only restrictions are the ones you make for yourself and it takes responsiblity and maturity actually set these restrictions...</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;My Experiences with Racism&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;By: Amanjit Jammu &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;When I was younger, I didn’t understand what racism really was. I mean, I knew that people all over the world were being discriminated against, including me. But, I always just accepted that this was the way things were, that some people just didn’t like others that had a different skin color from their own, or for whatever reason it may have been. Growing up in a small town, with very few visible minorities, elementary school was a complete nightmare. Often, I would be called derogatory names and have constant reminders that my skin color was different from others. Being the only visible minority in a roomful of 30 students, it was hard to &amp;quot;blend in&amp;quot;, and I would definitely stand out. The only part of school that kept me sane was the amazing friends I made who saw me for who I was and not for the color of my skin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;My experiences as a South Asian woman living in Canada have absolutely been shaped by my early years growing up. I have come to accept that not everyone is going to have an optimistic attitude towards certain groups of people. I have also come to realize that these people are ignorant and narrow-minded individuals and it definitely shows that they have a lack of awareness and acceptance for other ethnic groups. Whoever said that &amp;quot;sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me&amp;quot; had obviously never been a victim of racist insults. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;I’m not trying to show sympathy towards people who are racists, but sometimes I find that their racist attitudes may stem from the way that they were brought up. I mean, if their family makes racist remarks towards a certain group, that person may not know any different and is just sort of brought up to dislike a particular racial group. Even with that said, there’s no excuse for racism, but their upbringing may be one of the top contributing factors as to why racism is so predominant, even to this day. Because children usually develop certain attitudes at a young age, I think that elementary-school teachers should do more to prevent it from occurring and bring awareness to the classroom by having lesson plans about racism and the effects and consequences of it not only before it progresses, but before it becomes a normal, fixed attitude.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;Sometimes, I wonder how people can take one bad experience that they have had with a person of a different race and automatically decide that they hate all people of that race? For me, it’s like saying that if you find one rotten banana in the fruit basket that they all must be rotten too! (I don’t know if that’s the greatest example, but I think it gets the message across). It is sad to say, but as long as there are ignorant, bigoted people in this world, racism will never be a thing of the past. With that said, it is up to us to take a stand when we see or hear racist acts occurring. If we are within close distance, to sit back, and let an innocent victim be called derogatory names and be put down is simply, unacceptable. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, my experiences of racism have made me a stronger individual who is not going to let ignorant human beings bring my self-esteem and confidence level down. I actually feel sorry for these people because they are missing out on so many different experiences and opportunities when they refuse to let themselves interrelate with individuals of different races and cultures. Their loss, not mine. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Amanjit, great work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your last four words are what I was thinking of telling you before I read them. (Does that wording make sense?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone doesn't want to let certain people in, they are the ones missing out. Obviously you're not because you wouldn't want to be associated with that kind of person anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that something more has to be done than just saying &amp;quot;lets not do it.&amp;quot; REAL initiative must be taken to stop this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for your example about the fruit, don't say it isn't good. Like you said, it gets the point across and everyone can understand what you mean. Sometimes a metaphor is difficult to get because you don't know what the writer is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>Amanjit, this is a great piece of writing. Racism is a disgusting blight upon society.&lt;br /&gt;Something I noticed was that any sort of racism wasn't even an issue in my generation until the days of high school. I don't remember even being aware of anyone's skin colour until adolescence. It was then that I noticed some people began branching off into little cliques or whatnot, which were sometimes just Chinese people, or South Asian people.&lt;br /&gt;Now most of these groups I wouldn't consider racist as I'm sure that people are most likely to find a lot more in common with those who share a similar cultural background. I found that these types of people were friendly to anyone else regardless, and open to making new friends.&lt;br /&gt;There were those however, that were blatantly racist, and would not want to associate themselves with someone from another culture.&lt;br /&gt;It's sad that such narrow-minded thinking is still an issue in this day and age, and unfortunately I don't see any sort of end to this kind of behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a bit of a side note, has anyone here seen the movie Gran Torino? It shows perfectly what kinds of things people may be missing out on by harbouring descriminatory thoughts.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Wonderful writing Amanjit. It conveyed a really emotional and really personal story, and it was a very good read too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely agree with what you said. &amp;quot;Stick and stones...&amp;quot; is one of the most foolish sayings that we grow up with, because we're taught at a young age that what's on the inside is what matters. But it definitely hurts more to be called a name because it sits with you, internally, for a really long time. It's definitely not a well thought-out saying, and one that we all said as kids. But rather than parents teaching us a catchy little saying that suggests we don't get hurt by somebody else's words, why don't parents take responsibility and teach their children the difference between what's right and wrong: racism and rude remarks are wrong. &amp;quot;Sticks and stones...&amp;quot; is essentially a way of brushing the real issues aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with you that elementary schools need to do more to prevent racism, because I grew up in Surrey where there is a very large South Asian population, and I witness racism first hand. My earliest recollection is Grade 2; 7-year-olds who are discriminating against somebody because their skin colour is different. This is a much bigger issue than just one kid calling another a name, it's racism. And if it isn't cut off at the earliest age possible, we're going to continue to stall when it comes to minimizing and ultimately getting rid of racism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great writing!! It's very evokative.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

If you excise the above words from the habits of your writing, your writing will improve by about 20 percent. Just that one change. It's a speechification issue, more or less, and a common one.

I enjoyed the personal-ness of your narrative. It's unvarnished, which is good.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;Hypochondriac Psychotic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There was a time when I thought I had AIDS. It's actually a pretty funny story. Well, it wasn't that funny in the first place, it was more of a horrific clusterfuck (literally). But it definitely lights a smile on my face now and warms my dirty little heart. Not that I'm making light of AIDS. I'm not. If I did contract it, I'd probably be writing an entirely different story. But the fact is I didn't and it was a fantastic fluke over any sort of common sense that I dodged that bullet, because my life is alot like a runaway train. This is the sort of thing that happens to someone with twice the amount of luck and half the amount of brains that anyone should have. And it keeps on happening. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It started with a bottle of wine. A bottle of gewurztraminer to be exact and I know this because that's all I ever buy. Usually I save wine for when girls come over but this was a special occasion. I was mostly out of alcohol and pre-drinking is an essential ritual for weekend warriors. Grabbing the bottle and some road-beers, I rushed outside in response to the incessant bleeping of my best friend's van horn. The bearded devil opened the door and greeted me with the same satanic smile that I've always known. We were headed for the Railway Club. It was our friends album release, and we were intent on getting at least halfway-tipsy before we arrived. So I popped the cork, and we guzzled the fine white wine like it was a canteen in the desert. Arriving, we popped the leftover caps and basically inhaled the malt liquors as we marched to the bar. Once inside we ordered ales, ambers, lagers: pint after pint after pint. If drinking was an art, we were painting our masterpiece. I was told the album release went well, but who really cares, this isn't about that anyways. After the music stopped and we were certifiably un-sober, we hobbled, howling and fighting, all the way to our friends bar on Main. There, we consumed several night caps and I at last reached the level of sheer madness. I was nearly blind as I stumbled my way to the couch and there, curled up like a peaceful infant, I drifted. This is the absolute last thing I can remember of that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I woke up the next morning and realized, in spite of the darkness and slightly still drunk stupor, that I wasn't wearing any pants. Or a shirt, or underwear for that matter. Immediately after that I realized that there was a body beside me. And she was breathing. The next moment of clarity came slowly but hit equally as swift, I hadn't brought any condoms with me and therefore didn't likely use one. The panic set in like a pack of wild dogs and I sat in sheer disbelief of the horrors that surrounded me. I carefully felt out for my phone, simultaneously praying to every god that I wouldn't wake the body beside me. I found it, clutched it and flipped through it, stealthily under the covers. Using the blue sickly hue, I found my clothes and haphazardly threw them on while I silently flew from the room on my tiptoes. Passing the apartment door, my saunter turned to a gallop and I found my way out of the building, only to realize that I had no bloody clue where I was. I tried to call my friend as I treaded through the haze, but it was to no avail. I felt sick. I was lost and I smelled like dirty sex. I lit a cigarette like incense to try and get the lingering smell off of my skin. It didn't really work that well, but I tried a few more and kept walking. I kept harboring on thoughts of babies and gym-class videos of std's. I kept trying to calm myself down, but deep in my mind I was sure I'd contracted something. Maybe that feeling that I felt was chlamydia in my stomach, or worse, maybe it was AIDS. I panically strode through the sinister neighborhoods until I found the Main street station. I slumped on the bench, surrounded by business men and women and waited for the first train to come and take me away. The trip back home was pretty uneventful, except for the rising psychotic fear that was crawling up my spine and into my brain. On top of all of the previous fun, I managed to fall in the mud as I was taking a shortcut from the bus loop. Grumpily I ended up a muddied mess in my bed, hoping that when I woke up it'd all be a dream or at least I'd be dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I didn't die, unfortunately. I woke up to the call from that same goddamned fiend who let it all happen to me in the first place. I told him the circumstances, and after the bastard stopped laughing, he told me that I needed to go and get checked. He knew her, and even he wasn't that daring. Since I was generally a good boy before, even going to church on occasion, I had no idea what a check-up entailed. Visions of long silver needles going up the urethra and culture samples taken by sandpaper filled me with fear. I reluctantly called my doctor and booked an appointment for something made up, because the secretary who answered the phone sounded attractive. I met my doctor, he gave me a piece of paper and sent me to the STD checking clinic. At the clinic, I felt like everyone was glaring at me with disapproval because they all knew that I had fucked a dirty girl. After waiting for an unreal amount of time, they called my number. Surprisingly they didn't stick me with a needle below the waist, and there was just a tiny pin prick when they took a few pints of blood. The nurse was quite nice actually, and we cordially talked about something that was probably trivial or outright moronic because I can't recall it now. I left with a smile on my face. But the smile started to fade as the days passed with no response. I went from thinking I might have something to being pretty sure that I had the worst kind of something. Maybe it was taking so long because I had a new strain of AIDS and the scientists were so baffled that they kept running it through beakers and showing their friends. If I had a stomach ache, it was AIDS. Runny nose, it was AIDS. Sore throat, AIDS. I even went so far as to talk to a few of my closest friends about it. I couldn't take the waiting any longer, so I built up my courage and called my Doctor. The hot secretary answered and patched me through. In the most timid voice I've had in my entire life, I asked my doctor if the tests were in. He told me that they were and that I was in the clear. Apparently they only call you if something's wrong. I wanted to rip his beady little head off, but at least I was healthy. I didn't have AIDS, but I was indeed a dumbass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If there really are guardian angels, and I think there must be in my case, then I would have given mine an ulcer a long time ago. And I really don't need a demon because I'd probably be doing dumb things before he even thought of them. This isn't my first dance with danger, the closest, or even the best. This wasn't the first and is in no way the last. By nature, I'm reckless. Yes, I've learned from this, and i'll probably be smarter next time, blah blah blah. They say that you learn from your mistakes, but in my case I can ONLY learn from my mistakes. Eventually this train will crash if I keep up this speed and level of insanity, but I'm not really ready to give up my seat just yet. The ride's great, and from where I'm sitting, it's a damn good view. </MESSAGE>

Nothing is simple, everything is explain so that we can't miss even a bit of what was going on in your head. The panic was like wild dogs &amp;amp; the secretary was hot.. I could totally picture it all. Thanks for brightening my day with your horror story :)</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I enjoyed the straightforward-ness of this. You describe the unfolding of this scenario quite well, and you don't make an effort to dress yourself up -- which would be tempting, with this type of narrative. (I can't imagine a situation in which smoking a cigarette is going to make you smell better rather than worse; but hey, that's just me, a non-smoker.)

Now, here's the other part: get yourself out of the way. Try not to be a raconteur, or to do anything which sounds like &quot;a funny thing happened on the way to...&quot;. This is a serious story about personal fear and vulnerability. Don't lighten it up. This does not mean that you cannot be funny. On the contrary. But humour is a mercurial beast, and you use it too frequently here to slide away from the visceral discomfort of your situation.

One more thing: tighten it up. No more loose words and phrases. You know the ones I'm talking about (and if you don't, just look at all the other posts from me in this forum).</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worrying, it’s what I do best. But I worry too much. It grabs hold of my brain and doesn’t let go. I lay awake at night, the cranks turning in my head, worrying about anything and everything. Even the cool fabric of my pillow can calm my nerves. I turn the TV on, hoping the white noise will send me to dreamland. But it only serves to occupy my time because I usually find something to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a particular instance when I can remember the worrying being particularly bad because it always seems to be the same. I wish I could stop worrying. My stomach knots itself and my head splits over something as small as an upset customer at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like a small hole in the bottom of my stomach is slowly draining all of my energy (and logic.) It drives me crazy and it drives my friends crazy. They along with my family continually tell me that I shouldn’t worry, but I am too stubborn to listen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that my worrying is like an addiction. I need to worry about something to be comfortable. It goes as far as worrying about having nothing to worry about. As if I have forgotten something. Or I will search for something to worry about. When it is something not worth worrying over, I search for an angle that constitutes worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, unlike the rest of the population, my worrying doesn’t understand the concept of time. I worry about school in the dead of winter and while the sun is shining in summer, I worry about work. Obsession is another good word. In fact, I am worrying about writing this while I am writing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I long for the days of going out with friends and not worrying about being on time. Or travelling, enjoying the sites and not having to worry about what is going on at home. But most of all, I miss going to sleep at a decent hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assignment really got me thinking, I want to change this in the worst way. So I typed “worrying” into Google and clicked on the first link that appeared. The fact that I hadn’t done this before shocks me because I usually look up everything under the sun. Anyway, it says that we’re taught to worry as teenagers and if they aren’t frequent you are seen as irresponsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I see it in print, I realize that is how I really feel. I guess I think that if I don’t worry about something I seem immature or uncaring. But, being that it is a learned behaviour the site gives some tricks to stop it. You can’t teach a old dog new tricks, but I’m not old, so I will give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;oh man! I worry about everything as well. it consumes me most of the time... and i knwo exactly what you mean when you say it is an addiction. I search for things to worry about too. It is completely ridiculous... because it is usually about the smallest and most pointless things! ahh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for making me feel not so alone haha :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you kick the worry habit!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I like how the repetition here of the word &amp;quot;worry&amp;quot; creates the sense of obsession you're talking about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I feel that my worrying is like an addiction. I need to worry about something to be comfortable. It goes as far as worrying about having nothing to worry about. As if I have forgotten something. Or I will search for something to worry about. When it is something not worth worrying over, I search for an angle that constitutes worrying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I can totally relate to how you feel, especially lying awake at night with a millions thoughts running through my head every minute. I find a lot of the time when I worry about something I have the butterflies roaming around the pit of my stomach, ugh I hate it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back on track... I really love how you describe not being able to fall asleep even with the comfort of your pillow and bed sheets. I'm sure most of us can relate to this at some point, whether it is worrying about an exam or worrying about family situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great story Chantelle!&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

My favorite line was &amp;quot;It feels like a small hole in the bottom of my stomach is slowly draining all of my energy (and logic.)&amp;quot; I liked the ending as well where you related it to the information you found on Google. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Like most of us here, I can totally relate. As a teenager, I really didn't worry about anything at all. However, when I began college, three years ago, relentless worrying consumed most of my thoughts and still does. Most university students have a lot on their plate. Many work full or part time jobs and go to school full time. As fun and enlightening as school is, it sure does add to worrying. You've done an excellent job of conveying your emotion here and I really like how you describe worrying as addiction. &lt;br /&gt;Try, try, try NOT to watch TV when you can't sleep. As a bit of an insomniac myself, I used to always flick on the television, and, like you, would always manage to get engaged in some sort of program or show (for me, it's usually some stupid infomercial like mineral makeup or some convection oven product). This only intensified the problem because the tv ended up keeping me awake for longer. What I've been doing lately is getting up and writing for a few minutes to an hour. Write your worries away. Sometimes, when you write your problems down, you tend to see them in a new light. Give it a try! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>A thoughtful and interesting piece. Suggestions:

1. Avoid 'it'.
2. Look for inconsistencies in tense.
3. Avoid 'there is' and 'there are'.
4. Avoid 'really'.

Just work on tightening things up a bit.

                <MESSAGE> It began with piano lessons in the second grade. A black baby grand sat in our formal living room, and my father decided to capitalize on my early noodling. I'd created such masterpieces as &amp;quot;Red Fish,&amp;quot; after all, and he knew talent when he saw it. He promised me a rhinestone-encrusted piano à la Liberace if I became a famous pianist. I got to shake the flamboyant pianist's hand after one of his concerts. My piano career ended, however, when Mrs. Gallagher moved away after a year of my torment. In the fashion of one of the commercials of the day, I prefaced every piece with a whiny &amp;quot;Awww, gee, do I have to?&amp;quot; Perhaps I caused her relocation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No one else did homework over the summers, but mine were defined by enrichment exercises. One involved showing me an unknown object and having me deduce its purpose; another had something or other to do with writing stories. I dug my heels in, as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then came videos on study techniques -- SQ3R, which stood for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review. It seemed kindergartenish to study in such a repetitive manner, but my father was insistent. What he did not know was that I prolonged my homework and studying as long as I could in the hopes of avoiding his inevitable checking and quizzing. His stubborn insistence that I &amp;quot;Work smart, not hard&amp;quot; was matched by my stubborn insistence that he leave me alone. He tried Baroque music; he tried getting me to estimate the time for each assignment and beat the clock. All failed to produce his desired result -- a flawless performance in record time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was an A student already. More than that, I was an exceptional student, identified early as gifted, and my father was determined to milk it for everything it was worth. My childhood was a series of experiments in making me smarter, more efficient. That I was the smartest in my elementary school class bothered him; he did not like me used as a carrot on a stick for the other kids. That they hated me more than they envied me did not seem to warrant his notice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 7th grade, after changing schools, I took the SATs with a couple other kids in my class who had also been accelerated; I scored far above them. My father was deeply hurt that the school did not widely publicize my achievement. As a shy kid, frequently teased, I preferred anonymity. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I alone had qualified for an invitation to a ceremony at Duke University, which we accepted. As I and the other students sat at the front of the Duke Chapel, a young man spoke to us about living up to our potentials. My father seized upon the word as a mantra. He overenunciated it, popping the P sound and pronouncing the two syllables distinctly. I never heard the end of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Poh-tential.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally, finally, the enemy had a name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You did a realy good job at capturing your emotions. I truly empathized with you and wanted to take you away for a well deserved break LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially liked the last line. It puts a &amp;quot;face&amp;quot; to what is tormenting you, it wasn't your father at all, it was just what he saw in you and he wanted to bring it out even though you were already doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technique wise I found your writing very tight and it flowed nicely. Good job at creating images, the diamond crusted piano and a young you shaking the sparkly, shiny and crazy pianist were particularly good :D&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>That was a really enjoyable read.&lt;br /&gt;You captured some really good moments in time in expository bite-sized grafs, that aren't too long or too short. The line, &amp;quot;I'd created such masterpieces as 'Red Fish'&amp;quot; made me laugh. There's a wonderful imagery to a song like that, having prefaced it with a 7-year-old just playing around on the piano, and being oh so proud for having written a song. It brings back days from my piano career as a 9-year-old, but alas, I don't have any masterpieces, like you, to prove my talents.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I like the way how you layout the essay. I do play piano when I was in middle school. I did start late (in grade 7) for piano. I think everyone has so much different potential that they just haven't realize it yet. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Nice job. Good narrative structure, flow, and description. So, well done overall. Now, let's look at some details:

 

,----[ Never begin with the word 'it' (a rule often broken) ]
| 
| It began with piano lessons in the second grade. A black baby grand sat in our formal living room, and my father decided to capitalize on my early noodling. 
`----
,----[ Watch for sloppy words and phrases: I'd, a la, got to ]
| 
| I'd created such masterpieces as &quot;Red Fish,&quot; after all, and he knew talent when he saw it. He promised me a rhinestone-encrusted piano à la Liberace if I became a famous pianist. I got to shake the flamboyant pianist's hand after one of his concerts. 
`----


[snip: This part is fine (3 lines)]

,----[ You really need kindergartenish? Really? ]
| Then came videos on study techniques -- SQ3R, which stood for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review. It seemed kindergartenish to study in such a repetitive manner, but my father was insistent. 
`----

[snip: This part is fine: although, reduce quoting whenever possible (4 lines)]

,----[ Watch for words such as couple, far, and deeply. ]
| 
| In 7th grade, after changing schools, I took the SATs with a couple other kids in my class who had also been accelerated; I scored far above them. My father was deeply hurt that the school did not widely publicize my achievement. As a shy kid, frequently teased, I preferred anonymity. 
`----

[snip: This paragraph is good. (1 line)]

,----[ Excellent ending ]
| 
| &quot;Poh-tential.&quot;
| 
| Finally, finally, the enemy had a name.
`----

Very well done overall. Just a few little persnickety things.</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Meet Hans.</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hans Beeka - so named when she was twelve years old - is really called Rebecca. No one calls her this now, and she herself pronounces it strangely due to the lingering remnant of a peculiar accent picked up somewhere during childhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every weekday at seven in the morning, she jumps from her bunkbed onto my bed, and crushes my ankle. I grumble sleepily, curling away from the lights she turns on, glimpsing flashes of her back as she dresses for the schoolday. She is in the ninth grade, I think. Most days I still believe that she is ten years old. I try to write a poem about her, upon waking three hours later. There aren't sufficient words. Her picture looks back at me from the shelf in our room -- a red skinned dark haired baby. I give up and write about abstractions again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Hans when I was three. In my earliest memory, I sit at the top of a playground slide, and pray for a little sister. She doesn't look like me at all when she comes, even though her black hair transforms into blonde quickly. We are always opposites in childhood, circling around one another like orbiting planets. I grow tall and uncouth, sprouting buck teeth and gangly legs. She stays small, with a pert pink mouth and little white teeth. I read every scrap of writing I can find, and when my older cousin tells me&lt;br /&gt;what sex is, Hans is the first person I tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move across the country, sharing many bedrooms. My Mother keeps a photo of us curled together, asleep in a hotel room. We share a bed, a plastic dollhouse, hand-me-down dresses. We never go to school, and Mom eventually gives up on teaching us history and science at home. We can read, we can do math. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I am angry at Hans, but I can never afford to lose an ally. We share brothers too -- gap-toothed, stocky twin boys. When they fight, Hans tackles one of them, and I lock the other in the bathroom. One day, I betray Hans and join their side. We tie her up in a sheet, leaving her alone in the backyard. She forgives me, but a line has been crossed. New alliances form, and I join with Josh, the older twin, leaving Hans to fend for herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we go to school, and Hans cries every day for a week. The stone order of the elementary classroom, the unforgiving backs of the boys in front of her, the books with all the words she doesn't understand are too much. On the weekend, I cross my gangly legs in a corner near the fire and read French and Science textbooks. Hans blossoms timidly outwards once again in the comfort of home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stay at school, and she finds friends. Hans is separate from me. She becomes a baby, who takes breaks for recess and outdoor activities. She doesn't know French like I do. She is in grade three, and I am in the all-important world of middle school, in an advanced class. When she plays with the dollhouse on the weekend, I sit in our room and think about Jeffreys' and Davids', scrabbling thoughts in a diary. In High School I lose track of Hans completely. I think I fall in love, I think my heart is broken. My friends and I wear skin-tight jeans and haunt the malls on the weekend. Hans wears baggy pajamas and still braids her hair. I forget how old she is. We move again, and for the first time have separate bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weekend we play as we used to. I christen her Hans Beeka then, and we share a bedroom for the night with two friends. In the morning, we laugh at the twins, who sit for the day in front of the television, grasping playstation controllers and eating doritos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final move comes like a blow, part way through my year in the eleventh grade. Although I will still go to the same school, we move into a much smaller house. Hans and I have to share the smallest room yet. We stack bunkbeds, trying to fit books, clothes, and pictures into the space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She begins to step on my ankle. At first a green bruise blossoms, but soon I learn to sleep with a pillow over my feet. Always languid and uncouth, I sleep in later than she does. At night when I stay up talking on the phone, Hans listens in. She confronts me in the morning, imbued with an overpowering sense of right and wrong. Why are my friends doing&lt;br /&gt;things like that? Why am I friends with them? I roll my eyes in irritation. She begins to know me again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduation comes, and I take a summer job at a coffee shop. I see none of my friends from high school, I think I fall in love again. Hans goes away for the summer, and I wake up early to see her go. She leaves a voicemail on my phone that I play whenever I walk to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She comes home at the end of the summer. When she gives me a hug, I stand awkwardly, not knowing what to do. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Gilly missed you!&amp;quot; My Mother exclaims,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;'course not...&amp;quot; I stammer. I am as incapable of expressing emotion as my sixteen year old brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first year at college, Hans and I share clothes again. She steps on my ankle, I yell occassionally. We buy looser jeans, I still don't understand poetry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wake up, she crushes my ankle. I grumble sleepily and curl away from the lights she turns on. She is in high school, suddenly. I wonder if she has a diary full of Jeffreys' and Davids'. I watch groggily as she brushes her hair, puts on lipgloss. I am in my second year of University. There are a lot of things I still don't understand, and probably won't. But we are still two orbiting planets, and I realize as time passes how very similar we are. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;This was WONDERFUL! I really feel the love you have for your sister and how close you two really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great imagery and your writing really flowed. &lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE> This is fabulous -- the unique detail, the straightforward language. The matter-of-factness and lack of emotionality in the telling create a much more poignant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the repetition of:&lt;br /&gt;I think I fall in love, I think my heart is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed by:&lt;br /&gt;I think I fall in love again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the repetition of the Jeffreys and Davids, the oribiting planets, and the circle back to the ankle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like your use of the word &amp;quot;blossom&amp;quot; in describing the bruise. It reminds me of a Leonard Cohen poem:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; I heard of a man &lt;br /&gt; who says words so beautifully &lt;br /&gt; that if he only speaks their name &lt;br /&gt; women give themselves to him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; If I am dumb beside your body &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; while silence blossoms like tumors on our lips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; it is because I hear a man climb stairs and clear his throat outside the door.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;-Leonard Cohen, from “Let Us Compare Mythologies”&lt;/p&gt;Well done. :)&lt;br /&gt;

                <MESSAGE>You have a very obvious knack for writing. There are elements within your style that I really, really loved: the repetition and common thematic elements clearly play a big role in this story in particular, but it's a very good skill to have, and you seem to know how to play with it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is great imagery in this story; your descriptions of your siblings, the clothing styles, and the green bruise blossoming on your ankle. There is so much personality to this story, and so much heart in here. I'm curious if you've had your sister read this? I'm sure she would love it. It's a beautiful representation of the sibling relationship.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Thank you all so much! I've been thinking about letting her read it...it's funny, its so easy to write something about your family and share it with other people, but so much more difficult to share it with your family! Your feedback has been very encouraging :)</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Very good. Expressive and clear, with good rhythm. Let's look at some nuts and bolts:

,----[ Avoid the words 'really' and 'sometimes' ]
| 
| Hans Beeka - so named when she was twelve years old - is really called Rebecca. No one calls her this now, and she herself pronounces it strangely due to the lingering remnant of a peculiar accent picked up somewhere during childhood. 
`----

[snip: This part is good, though we could use more details about time and place (4 lines)]

,----[ Good ]
| 
| We move across the country, sharing many bedrooms. My Mother keeps a photo of us curled together, asleep in a hotel room. We share a bed, a plastic dollhouse, hand-me-down dresses. We never go to school, and Mom eventually gives up on teaching us history and science at home. We can read, we can do math. 
`----
,----[ Also good ]
| 
| Sometimes I am angry at Hans, but I can never afford to lose an ally. We share brothers too -- gap-toothed, stocky twin boys. When they fight, Hans tackles one of them, and I lock the other in the bathroom. One day, I betray Hans and join their side. We tie her up in a sheet, leaving her alone in the backyard. She forgives me, but a line has been crossed. New alliances form, and I join with Josh, the older twin, leaving Hans to fend for herself. 
`----
,----[ Avoid 'eventually', and watch for compressing things too much ]
| 
| Eventually we go to school, and Hans cries every day for a week. The stone order of the elementary classroom, the unforgiving backs of the boys in front of her, the books with all the words she doesn't understand are too much. On the weekend, I cross my gangly legs in a corner near the fire and read French and Science textbooks. Hans blossoms timidly outwards once again in the comfort of home. 
`----

[snip: Good (10 lines)]

,----[ Avoid adverbs whenever possible. Correct the apostrophes. Avoid 'lots'! Good ending... ]
| 
| Today I wake up, she crushes my ankle. I grumble sleepily and curl away from the lights she turns on. She is in high school, suddenly. I wonder if she has a diary full of Jeffreys' and Davids'. I watch groggily as she brushes her hair, puts on lipgloss. I am in my second year of University. There are a lot of things I still don't understand, and probably won't. But we are still two orbiting planets, and I realize as time passes how very similar we are.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Who do you love? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is unconditional.  Love does not fall away because of disappointment or failure.  Love cries with you, and rejoices with you.  My mom is the person&lt;br /&gt;who I love more than anything in the world and that love is reciprocated. From the day that I was born she has cared for me unconditionally, meeting my every need. She's there for me no matter what.  She's my shoulder to cry on, but also my companion to laugh with.  I know that no matter what I do she will always be there for me, no matter how much I disappoint her or anyone else.  She has loved me so dearly, yet I feel that my love has not been completely reciprocated towards her, as she has spends all her hours taking care of me, and it has has sometimes been met with ingratitidue.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

But, when I read it, I realized that it doesn’t have to be long in order to prove something. It’s short, but it captures the essence of who you love. I loved the emotion, and I’m sure many people see their mom’s in the same way, as do I. Great job! &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I love being able to read about the relationships that people my age have with their parents because a lot of people are still in that teenage mindset that parents are embarrassing and such, resulting in such ingratitude. And I'm glad you addressed that because that's the beauty of the balance of the relationship we all have, or have had, with our parents. There's a moment in we all have when we get over this paranoia that our parents are out to ruin our lives, and we can put that ingratitude behind us and reciprocate that love to our greatest ability. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Good job. Clear and honest. Of course, love is not unconditional but feels that way sometimes. The simplicty of the piece allows the reader to overlook the small and quibbling notion that love is highly conditional. Nicely done.

Watch for extra and imprecise words: completely, all, every, more, anything, etc. For all of these, there exist more precise methods of expression. But overall,the piece flows well and is quite sweet (I assume that is your basic idea, to make the piece unvarnished).</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>The Ear</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> I saw eight doctors and five specialists to find out why my right ear was blocked. I thought it was Swimmer's Ear which didn't make a lot of sense because I hardly ever went swimming. I yawned, shook my head, chewed gum, took Sudafed but nothing would shake, what I believed to be, a fistful of wax wedged inside my head. Each doctor would peer into my ear, say that it looked pretty clean and then ask if I had tried chewing gum or taken Sudafed. They all followed the same script until I saw the last specialist, a frail man who looked to be about 102 years old, who banged a metal rod across my head and held it to the afflicted ear to see if I could hear the reverberation. I told him that while I appreciated waiting four months to experience his new technique, I couldn't hear the hum of the metal. You know, ear blockage and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend at the time muttered something about the blockage being imaginary. Then I passed out. It wasn't a faint worthy of a dainty Scarlett O'Hara, rather it was like I was instantaneously possessed by a street drunk, gulping the last of his bottle before stumbling forward into a heap on the floor. The room was traveling at the speed of light and I vomited. I've been here before, I thought, but usually the lead-up is a lot more fun. So, back to the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extreme vertigo combined with the blockage meant that I had Ménière's disease, the old guy said. I didn't look at him because I was angry, instead focusing on his training certificates on the wall. He had received his Ears, Nose and Throat training some time ago, his plastic surgery qualifications, more recently. Explains the metal rod thing. I asked him about the vertigo attacks, imaging myself lying listlessly on a rainy sidewalk, passersby poking me with sticks to see if I was alive. The doctor shrugged and told me to pop Gravol. I argued. I told him I go from normal to ill in 30 seconds, not long enough for the medication to work. For those of you who don't know, Ménière's, aside from all the cool accents on the letters, is a horrible, horrible thing. It is characterized by vertigo, tinnitus and fullness to the ear which is best described by the feeling of pressing an empty glass to your ear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided I didn't want anything to do with it. I booked an appointment with a naturalpath, choosing based on who was on the B-Line bus route. I was too scared to drive. In addition to good magazines, there was a miniature waterfall gurgling on the coffee table in the waiting room. A good sign. The naturalpath's name was Brian and he had plush chairs in his office. I instantly liked him. He had heard of Ménière's. He had one patient who had the same symptoms, but actually had a brain tumor. Another patient, screwed-up neck so inner ear fluid wasn't draining properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a chiropractor two days later and he took an X-Ray of my neck. Carrying heavy bags of camera equipment and purses stuffed full had coaxed my neck over to the right side. Three appointments later, my ear cleared, I had a new appreciation for alternative medicine and gave the boyfriend the boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>What a great read Rebecca. It was one of those stories that I had absolutely no idea what to expect as it went on. Your paragraph about the street drunk is very well written and provides really good imagery. For a five paragraph story, you were able to place us in the setting really well, with quick blurbs of description that works perfectly, as well as the description of the old specialist is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a shame that camera equipment does this, eh? I've had neck problems since adding lenses to my SLR, so if anything happens, I will definitely go see a naturalpath and chiropractor. I also like that your naturalpath choice was based on the B-Line route!&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Basically very good. I say 'basically' because the writing is clear, the ideas expressive, the narrative sound -- and (never say 'but') it's too short to explicate all of what you are trying to say. As an example, look at the end of the first and beginning of the second paragraphs. You go from the doctor's office to passing out without telling us where this happened. So, we're still in the office. Then you talk about going back to the doctor -- and we're lost.

So: keep up the excellent work with imagery, description, metaphor, and expressiveness. Your craft skill is quite good. Work on the flow of your narrative. This is really a 2500 word piece. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>August 30, 2006. This was the day I watched &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/span&gt;; I still have the ticket stub in my desk drawer. This was the day I realized which path I wanted to take when university ended. This was a day of realization, a day of personal growth, and above all, it was a day of sheer disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weekend prior, my parents went to see the aforementioned film and came home ranting about its genius; its remarkable comedy. My mom said it was one of the funniest movies she’d ever seen, and I believed her. The cast was fantastic, the plot, as I knew it, was wonderful, and it was getting praise from almost every film critic around. I was really looking forward to seeing it, and that was my downfall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know on Thanksgiving, when the mélange of turkey and stuffing fill your home with mouth-watering aromas, but when you get to the meal it’s dry and flavourless? &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/span&gt; was my first dry turkey. It was the first time in my movie watching career that I had gone in with excessively high expectations, and come out utterly disappointed. It wasn’t the film I was told about, or read about. It was a dark comedy whose humour wasn’t the laugh-out-loud kind that I had been promised by so many. And for the hour and 40 minutes that I sat in the back row of the near-empty theatre, I was pretty pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/span&gt; has been described by many as “the most perfect film of all time.” I was 19 when I first saw it, a little after Little Miss Sunshine, and like the turkey dinner, I was disappointed. It has held a near-perfect rating on IMDB since the website opened and it has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, yet I don’t think it necessarily warrants that rating. But before you feel the need to criticize my opinion, I will say that I did enjoy the movie; I thought every aspect of it was amazing. But it’s not the greatest movie I’ve ever seen, and I will argue that it’s not the greatest movie you’ve ever seen either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call my problem the ‘Little Miss Sunshine Predicament.’ It occurs when you go into a movie with ridiculously high expectations that are no way possible to live up to. In my 19 years before seeing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/span&gt;, most people who had seen it told me that it was the best movie they’ve ever watched. Of course I went into it expecting so much more than Coppola could deliver, and that’s not his fault, nor is it a detriment to the film. And there really is nobody to blame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, my film tolerance is like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_Game&quot;&gt;Range Game&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Price is Right&lt;/span&gt;. As my expectations get higher, the red window of expected enjoyment moves higher too. And there is a point in my expectations when the span of the range window shrinks, thus giving the film a much smaller threshold to live up to my preconceived standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I walked out of the theatre after watching &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/span&gt;, my friends ragged on me for my poor taste in movies; after all, I was the one who dragged them there. Their expectations weren’t met either. Standing out in the summer sun, I realized then that I wanted to be a film critic. There are no right and wrong answers in that line of work, as long as you can back up your arguments. If you don’t like a film, that’s your prerogative, and you get paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since rewatched &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/span&gt;, and enjoyed it a lot more than I did the first time because my expectations were negligible based on bad memories. I haven’t mustered up the courage to rewatch &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Godfather&lt;/span&gt;, though I will someday soon. For now though, I don’t feel like I deserve a career as a film critic.&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; The Godfather&lt;/span&gt; remains my dry turkey, for the simple fact that I can’t honestly say that it was the greatest movie ever, which, it appears, is a mandatory requirement to work in that field.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. Previously, I had heard terrible things about the movie, so when I watched it, I found it exceeded my expectations. I guess the whole problem is with having expectations in the first place...websites like Rotten Tomatoes don't help either. Expectations, in many ways, can either make or break a movie. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Kyle, that is great. I, too, experienced your 'Little Miss Sunshine Predicament' as I finally rented the movie after hearing friends go on about how both hilarious and touching it was. I think it was Rolling Stone that summed it up as being &amp;quot;&lt;span class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;National Lampoon's Family Vacation&lt;/i&gt; with soul.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; Expectations were high and I kept waiting for it to get, well, funny. Sure, it was cute and got the occasional chuckle out of me but I felt disappointed when the end of the movie came and I was still waiting. Of course, this led to disappointment from friends who had loved the movie and when they found out I didn't, we stared at each other warily in silence, wondering if we really knew each other as well as well as we thought we did. I didn't care. After all, the moral of the movie was that it's okay to be a loser.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Kyle, amazing work! First of all it was really cool to get an inside look at how you felt about LMS, I never really heard you describe it this way in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once I saw it, I too felt it wasn't what people said it would be. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, but as you said, it wasn't laugh outloud, side splittling comedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job again man!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

I do totally understand about disappointments especially when you read a book then watch the movie. It's so much better to just go in blind don't expect things cause disappointment sucks. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Good imagery, pacing, and clarity. Suggestions: try to remove the word 'it' whenever possible. Also, be judicious about using semi-colons (or, at least be consistent). A few more:

Never use &quot;you know&quot;.
Never use &quot;pretty&quot; (except as an adjective of beauty).
Never use &quot;really&quot;.
Never use &quot;a lot.&quot;

The above short list represents, you know, a pretty short list of words and phrases that are, you know, really used a lot in speech but are not so effective in writing.

The above words and phrases are redundant, ineffective, and to be avoided in good writing.

                <MESSAGE>     One evening when the sun had gone and the moon ruled the sky I found myself standing before an old friend.  In past years my friends and I had spent hours hanging, climbing, and laughing from its strong branches.  That night the memory stood fresh and crisp in my mind like the chill January air and I breathed in deep.  The tree was dark and heavy in the night, but it was not menacing and I approached it without fear.&lt;br /&gt;     I reached out and placed a half numb hand on the trunk of the evergreen to feel the rough bark.  It was cold to the touch, but I knew that was merely the weather and felt like I could sense the life beneath.  I remembered the fun we once had here. I thought about how we never gave more than a second thought to the life of the tree which gave us a playground.&lt;br /&gt;     We were new friends at the time.  We had known nothing of the future and what it may hold for us.  Back then all we needed was to run and play and for that we were grateful.  Time continued regardless of our childhood fantasies and we remained friends, every one of us that had once placed under this tree.&lt;br /&gt;     I leaned my back against the trunk as the bark dug uncomfortably into it.  Before me lay a field shrouded in the night so that it seemed to go on forever.  I thought of what this tree meant to me and what it had given me.  My friends, still laughing and climbing and sharing their lives with mine.  My love may have took sprout here without my noticing it at the time.  She was one of us.&lt;br /&gt;     I realized, then, that when we strive for love we find something else.  We find a hopeless infatuation that we pretend is love and fake it until it hurts.  It was here under this watcher, surrounded by friends,  striving for fun, when love found me.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>After reading this, I come away with a strong sense of nostalgia. I also enjoyed the poetic style of writing you chose to employ here and as said previously, your use of imagery really allows me to visualize exactly what's going on.&lt;br /&gt;Your use of personification also conveyed how much this tree actually means to you, and definitely distinguishes it as something of far greater importance than perhaps how the average person may view it.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Christopher, I love the imagery and personification you used to describe the tree, and how you did so with vivid poetic language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed the ending where you said &amp;quot;I realized, then, that when we strive for love we find something else.  We find a hopeless infatuation that we pretend is love and fake it until it hurts.  It was here under this watcher, surrounded by friends,  striving for fun, when love found me,&amp;quot; because I think that is true for all of us, we don't find something until we stop looking for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that you captured the importance of things that seem irrelevant. To other people the tree you are speaking of is probably meaningless, we all pass by it without thought... but to you it holds great importance and is a huge part of your life !&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>A nice, languid description. Suggestion: add the word 'it' to your list of prohibited words (except when absolutely required):

Before me lay a field shrouded in night, extending forever.

Take out the 'it' and the entire sentence reconfigures as a poem.

Nice piece. Nostalgic.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>And then what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever stopped to ask yourself that? You take your wildest dreams, your biggest goals and every desire, and simply tack on those three words; and then what? I’ve found this question to be incredibly useful in evaluating goals and motives, not only for myself but for others also.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Depending on your mood, asking ‘and then what?’ could be perceived as being negative or positive. Some may see it as a way to downplay the significance of almost anything, while others could see it as a meaningful question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you’re really unsure as to what your motives are behind something until you sit down and think what happens when everything is over?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it all boils down to whether or not you’re an optimist or a pessimist; a half-full or half-empty type of person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example: You’ve just won the lottery, written a book, cured cancer. Whatever your goal in life, you’ve done it and everything is how you imagined it. And then what? What do you do when there’s nothing left to do? What’s the significance of having the fastest and most expensive car? The latest and greatest iPhone or being the smartest person ever? What if you find what you’re looking for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, most people would simply move onto to other things, draw up some new pursuits. Is it because their interested, or simply to keep busy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I’ve jumped back and forth between the pessimist and the optimist. I find that when it comes to certain goals I’ll find myself trying to justify the ends, and other times I’ll realize that this particular goal/conquest/pursuit is meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, I’m done my rant/composition, but I think I’ve completed what I set out to do. Now what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;I knew I wanted to get into the work force, but I also wanted time off. Now that the end is drawing near and the question is being asked more often. It is really making me think about what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> I totally relate to Amanjit on this, and I'm glad you wrote about this Chris, because it's something that I quickly realized should be considered. I've never really thought about &amp;quot;And then what?&amp;quot; before, and I likely should. It would give us a better idea of understanding our actions, and it would probably result in us all making smarter choices in life. Although we do, of course, learn from our mistakes, asking &amp;quot;And then what?&amp;quot; gives us the preemptive opportunity to think about the goals we make, the things we set out to do, and put that in perspective. It was a very enjoyable read Chris. You were able to put that right amount of doubt in my mind, and give us some really good food for thought. Nicely done!!&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, very interesting and thoughtful. Here are a couple of suggestions:

* Make it more personal. What about you? In what way does this question find its way into your life? Don't just ask us; tell us. Give us some examples.

* Watch for speechification. You are writing, and this a more precise (a much more precise) mode of communication. Your wods should not sound like they are part of a conversation.

* Watch for extra words and phrases (this is part of speechification, which is not really a word but is self-explanatory).

Again: give us more than idea. Give us one clear, shining example of the question in your own life. One moment, one choice, one situation. Show it, don't (only) tell it.

Lots of suggestions here; not too many, I hope. I'm just thinking about craft...</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I do not come from a religious family.I used to attend youth group in high school as well as church. The older I became more responsibilities came and there was less time to take part in my spiritual activities. Yes I believe in something more than myself and that my life will not end when I die. However this belief in the spiritual was strengthened starting on October 30, 2008.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On October 30, 2008 I found out after eleven months of fighting that my Nanny was done fighting. All the bits and pieces in side her human body had stopped fighting to live and slowly gave up on my Nanny's body. For two and a half excruciating days we watched her die. She was so drugged up for the pain that she was never mentally with her family as she breathed her last breaths. She would talk but it would be in the direction where no one was but she looked convinced that she was talking to someone. It looked like she was talking to someone. Someone she new. Someone close to her. She had many conversation with her deceased mother and my deceased Grandad. They were there to help her let go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As family came and went from her hospital room all you could feel was warmth in the room. Even when I was alone with her in the room the room was warm. I never felt alone in the room. I always felt surrounded by love and comfort. When I said my last goodbyes she promised me she would be there for me. She promised to be at my wedding, see me have kids and be there for when it is my turn to go. In return I promised her that I would not forget her and that my children would know her through my memories. Saying goodbye to someone who has seen you grow for the past 24 years is not something you take lightly. I cried. I cried when I said goodbye, during her memorial, when a song sounded even a little bit sad (that included some heavy metal, yes that's right heavy metal made me cried.), when my boyfriend would not take gas money for driving me around because I was in no state to drive and for no apparent reason out of the blue I would cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 2, 2008 during the very early morning when nobody wants to be awake my Nanny was gone. Sluggishly my boyfriend got out of bed to drive me to the hospital. We were allowed to be with my Nanny's dead body for as long as we needed. I was the first one at the hospital besides my Aunt Debbie and Uncle Matt who had stayed overnight with her. As I walked into my Nanny's hospital room darkness swept over me. The room that was once overwhelmingly warm and full was bare and empty. The energy that was enveloping the room while my Nanny stilled breathed got sucked away when my Nanny's spirit left the room. The energy was never there for us that were still living but there for my Nanny only. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a near death experience to give me a sense that living exists beyond the physical. When my Nanny left the physical I became aware of what is not physical. Even though I couldn't see what was around me I could feel it. If I could feel it then it must have been physical. If it was physical then it did exist. What happened in that tiny four walled private room was not seen but felt. Anyone who came into that room over that long weekend felt what I felt in there own way. I learned to trust what you can feel even if it can not be seen. I learned that if you feel it hard enough the spiritual becomes physical and no one can tell you otherwise because for that moment for me it was felt, seen and physical. &lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I too want to start by saying I am so sorry for the loss of your Nanny. This was amazing work, very emotionally charged and filled with intense images. I truly felt like I was there with you and this actually reminded me a little bit of lossing my Aunt a couple of years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an amazing read and thank-you for sharing your story with us.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry for your loss. I think you captured everything perfectly. I can relate to the entire situation, I watched my mother die in a hospital room, and this is what it felt like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this sentence: &amp;quot;The energy that was enveloping the room while my Nanny stilled breathed got sucked away when my Nanny's spirit left the room&amp;quot; because it is definitely true.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom died 8 years ago and I still feel her around me. Whether it is a spiritual thing or just the comfort of my memories, I know she will never be gone completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for this emotional piece, it was probably difficult to write.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>Melissa, I am so sorry for your loss. Your piece was full of vivid, emotional imagery and to read it, gave me goosebumps.&lt;br /&gt;When my Grandma passed away three years ago, I too felt that energy you so perfectly described. Several weeks before her passing (and up until her death), she constantly talked about a little blue bird flying around her bedroom. She would lay there in her bed and just watch this bird, her eyes following it intently. Some of my family members said that she was probably hallucinating (she was on heavy doses of morphine at the time), but I honestly felt like the bird symbolized something. Whether it was an angel, or god, I don't know, but I do know that it was something spiritual, that only she could see. I totally agree with your feelings about the spiritual becoming physical. Just because we can't see it doesn't mean it's not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

In terms of skill development, try to focus more on specific details which immerse the reader in the narrative. Say less and tell more. This is just a matter of practice.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Nothing to fear but feat itself. That might be true for some individuals living in a bubble that protects them from the world, but we all know that bubble doesn't exist - and if it does, it pops within the first second of being given life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a six-year-old girl living in Delta and commuting to Richmond on an almost daily basis with my parents, I would fear the horrible death of drowning. But not in a sense that I would drown in a pool, or fall off a bridge for that matter. I believed that driving through the dark, dinging tunnel on highway 99 was actually a portal into a water hell.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One minute, the birds are chirping, flying through the baby blue sky or perching themselves a top giant trees which have been there longer than I've been alive; the next, darkness surrounds you, sounds of water and car engines fill the toilet-paper-like tube, and all you can see are flashes of light. In movies they always told me, &amp;quot;don't go toward the light&amp;quot; so why the hell were my parents driving me towards the light at the end of the tunnel!?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I believed that the closer you get the to light, the closer you were to being crushed by the water rushing in through the other side. The Titanic movie wasn't released around this time, but do you remember when Jack and Kate were trying to escape from inside the boat, and they opened up one of the doors and water rushed in from the other side? That's what tunnels in Richmond are like, at least that's what I through they were.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My dad told me he had the same fear when he was little. Him and his parents would drive through tunnels, and he would scream at the top of his lungs because he thought the walls would collapse and he would drown in his red choochoo train pajamas which will the most popular kind of pjs in the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; So much for &amp;quot;nothing to fear but fear itself,&amp;quot; I guess whoever wrote this line thought tunnels were nothing... I wish. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hahaha, I think  alot of kids had that fear, I know I did. And I think m y mom did too haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very good Caprice, I like the simplicity of it all. I believe most of us here know which tunnel you're talking about and if we don't then we know of one like it. We can all picture driving through the darkness with just the nasty orange lights guiding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only fear I have of the tunnel now is getting stuck behind an accident in there. No music, no cell service, nothing to do but wait.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

I wonder where that fear came from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of fathers and tunnels, when I went to Kwantlen the first time around, I drove a VW bug that was ALWAYS breaking down and since I had to take the tunnel back and forth from school every day, I always did a silent prayer the bug wouldn't break down (Pleeeeeeeese, anywhere but here!). My dad told me to never, ever take the counterflow lane, fearing a head-on collision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great subject to write about, Caprice!&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this. Especially the connection the the &amp;quot;nothing to fear but fear itself&amp;quot; line... I'm still terrified of tunnels. They are horrible things, and I think you described them perfectly in this paragraph &amp;quot;One minute, the birds are chirping, flying through the baby blue sky or perching themselves a top giant trees which have been there longer than I've been alive; the next, darkness surrounds you, sounds of water and car engines fill the toilet-paper-like tube, and all you can see are flashes of light. In movies they always told me, &amp;quot;don't go toward the light&amp;quot; so why the hell were my parents driving me towards the light at the end of the tunnel!?&amp;quot;, I laughed at the last part, i never thought of it that way.. but I think it really added to the piece. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Caprice, I can totally relate to your story. I'm not too fond of the Massey Tunnel either, and when I absolutely have to go through the tunnel (for school), I always drive as fast as I can (keeping within the speed limit, of course). The line, &amp;quot;I believed that driving through the dark,dinging tunnel on highway 99 was actually a portal into a water hell&amp;quot; creates vivid imagery. Great story! </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>A nice description of a common and creepy fear. Look at the first sentence and see if you can find the error (it's a spelling error). Also, look up the origin of this quotation (it's from a war). Watch for extra and speechified words (guess, being, would, wasn't, etc.). Remember: writing is a kind of meditation. Also, look up the word 'dinging' (if you can).</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I wanted to try something new. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Twenty five sentences on the theme of falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I'm afraid of heights. Afraid isn't the right word. Disturbed, discombobulated, disassociated - the reversal of connection prods me, forty feet above the ground. My feet hang, a nagging urge to push a toehold in the air. The toes are the first sign I should get down. The shivering lead rope pressing into my wet palms is the second. The squirrel in my chest, approaching a hundred and seventy beats per second, is the third. They are each an excellent sign of distress, calling for my immediate descent and fervent rejoicing to be on the ground. Except I can't. I'm stuck.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I fell, throat bulging to loose that scream of 'that thing you didn't want to happen, well it did'. The arms go up in mimicry of the sparrows watching my ascent. Perhaps in this moment, I discovered human flight. Leaving my rope and harness behind, I would soar through the forest canopy and avoid airports for the rest of my life. The clench of nylon straps and the sharp pain of my extra carabiner hitting my hip declared my discovery a fraud. The fall finished its momentum, leaving me to dangle mid-air. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Time lags, following the off kilter timekeeper in my chest. A minute becomes a day, an hour, a second. Time does not resume normal operations until the body gives out, unable to keep up with unrealized dismemberment. The body believes the bluff, the fall is still happening. A stuttering connection between mind, spinal column and adjuncts load the arsenal of endorphins to combat this near-disaster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I hang in my harness, giddy and shaking from the aftermath. The fall would have ended down there with the ferns and moss and cedar, forty feet below me. The gap between my mind and my body troubles me more.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You wanted to try something new and you succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how you were able to say so much with so few words. You created a really cool image in our minds. And you were able to get us to feel your emotions, I too could feel my throat bulging.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading this because you went in a completely different direction than i was expecting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can picture the entire scene.. both the physical aspect of it and the emotions swarming in your head!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how you referred to the &amp;quot;squirrel&amp;quot; in your chest, I think that is a really good description for the feelings that accompany fear, nervousness and slight excitement!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, an interesting and useful experiment. When working in this type of narrative style, the challenge involves compression: too much, or not enough. Some of these sentences are one or the other (5 is too compressed). By 'compression' I mean how much you can say with the fewest words. There exists a potentially perfect balance of this in every composition, but this balance is exceedingly difficult to find. The thing to look for is this: how much can you leave out while still conveying the complete message? Over-compression happens when there is a piece or pieces missing; slackness happens with extra words (of which there aren't too many here). Watch for tense changes also. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I am the definition of a 'daddy's girl'. I have no problem saying it and I do not get offended when other people say it to me. I'm sure many of them use it to imply that I am selfish or spoiled and expect me to be insulted, but I take it as a compliment. I am beyond lucky that I have a father worth worshipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I still remember vividly the first argument we ever had. I wanted to sleep over at my friend’s house, but I was not allowed to I expected him to take my side but when he sided against me, I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I ran away. I packed my two teddy bears in a pillow case and decided to walk to my friend’s house. It went well until I hit the end of the sidewalk and realized I could in no way cross the street without an adult’s hand. So I waited, and eventually he came and got me. &amp;quot;Why did you leave&amp;quot; he asked me, &amp;quot;because you yelled at me&amp;quot; I explained, and he said &amp;quot;Running away will not make your problems disappear. Just because I do not agree with you, does not mean I do not love you, it just means that maybe you should think twice about what you are doing. &amp;quot; That is some pretty deep advice for a five year old, but to this day I still remember it word for word, and it is still the advice I take to heart the most. Even now at 22 years old, when my father refuses to agree with me, I re-evaluate my decision. He has this amazing ability to leave emotion out of decision making, and I am the most emotional person I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     My dad has never left me responsibility-free. When I was 14 my mom died rather suddenly and after a short while of being depressed, my dad informed me that we could no longer dwell on it. He took on the role of both parents and forced me to take on the role of an adult, something I am forever grateful for, because everyone else was offering me free passes out of anything important. I even managed to get an A in math 9 without understanding one concept. I don't think my math skills ever recovered, but my life skills did. My dad forced me to deal with tragedy head on and told me to never forget that I was strong enough to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     I do not see my dad as often anymore, he lives here only 6 months of the year and travels the rest, but I still call him daily to talk about everything. When people call me a &amp;quot;daddy's girl&amp;quot;, I hope they notice the smile across my face, because I am proud to be his daughter, and I hope that because I am a daddy's girl, I hold some of the values that he does, and am able to instil them on others. I hope that I never stop being his little girl, because honestly, that is my favourite part about myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Amanda, that was so touching. I am sorry that you lost your mother at such a young age. But your relationship you have with your dad mirrors mine. We can talk about anything and I too am proud to be a Daddy's girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great job at conveying such emotion. I truly understand the deep bond you have with your father :D&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>There are too many family that is similar to your case. The father is working aboard for goods. I like the essay because it is very personal and original. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some run-on sentence which make the essay so hard to follow at some point. Overall the essay is very well organized.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

When I was eight years old my dad was diagnosed with cancer and throughout his fight with it we grew extremely close. He taught me a lot about responsibility and it really forced me to grow up and figure out what the real world is all about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm proud to call myself a &amp;quot;Daddy's Girl&amp;quot; =)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, a touching and somehow innocent piece. Personal and emotional. Suggestion: work on punctuation. This mostly shows up in the junctures between phrases, eg:

I wanted to sleep over at my friend’s house, but I was not allowed to I expected him to take my side but when he sided against me, I wasn't quite sure what to do, so I ran away.

There are about three punctuation errors here, and I will leave you to find them (homework!). Hint: the above should be more than one sentence.

It’s not that I don’t like dogs, because I do. In fact, I’ve been surrounded by dozens of different animals throughout my life. Cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, hamsters, rabbits, horses, donkeys, sheep. And that’s only to name a few. There’s just something about cats that I’ve always been particularly fond of. When I was a little girl, no more than four or five, my mom found me in the barn, with one of our female cats as she gave birth to her first litter of kittens. I was lying next to her in the hay, stroking her soft grey and white fur, telling her what a good girl she was and that she was doing a good job. Kind of like a birthing coach, I suppose. My mom said that it was one of the sweetest things she's ever witnessed. I don't remember that, but there's tons of pictures of me as a child carrying around little balls of fur flopped over my shoulder -- little pink, wet noses, poking through the mass of fluffy, velvet kitten fuzz. Wherever I went, a cat or kitten followed, and I would spend endless hours with my little feline friends. My Mom said that in my past life, I must have been a cat.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;So when I moved out on my own five years ago, I took my six year old male, Milo with me. Milo is the sweetest, kindest, and laziest cat I've ever owned. He is a thirty pound, orange and white lion of a cat. Yes, thirty pounds is a very big for a cat. However, he's not fat. He's just big boned -- or at least that's what I try and tell myself. After a year or so, Milo became very lonely and reserved. He has always been around other cats and I could really tell that he was missing his girlfriend, Puss Puss (my step-mom's cat). So when my Mom happened to pick up two kittens from the SPCA and asked me if I wanted one of them, I jumped at the chance. That day, I brought home little Smoky, a grey and white ball of relentless energy. Smoky was like a rebellious teenage girl; she had no fear, and was constantly testing her limitations. Since I live on a busy road I was extremely reluctant about letting her go outside. However, every time I let Milo out the door she would just sit there, crying and whining like a child having a temper tantrum. Finally, when so was about four months old, I gave in and let her go outside. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;A few weeks later I had noticed this feral male cat hanging around. He looked like he had been through a war – his orange hair was disgustingly matted and he had patches of hair that we’re missing (possibly from fighting). He looked so skinny and gaunt that I couldn’t help but put a few crunchies out on the porch for him. This was a bad idea. Once you feed a stray cat, they never go away. He wasn’t really a problem until he started growling at Milo one day. It got to the point where he felt as if my house was his territory, and he often lashed out at both Milo and Smoky for no particular reason. One day, I caught him mating with poor Smoky. At first I thought he was attacking her, but then, as I ran outside and got a closer look, I could tell what was going on. I ran over, yelling and cursing and he quickly ran away into the bushes. She was only five months old and I figured that she was too young to get pregnant. I was planning to take her to get spayed, but I had to wait until she was at least six months. A few weeks passed by and I soon noticed her rather lean frame become heavier. Her stomach had begun to grow and soon, it was obvious that she was pregnant. I was mad at myself for letting this happen. There’s all ready too many unwanted animals in this world and I didn’t want to bring any more into it. However, due to my stupidity and ignorance (or maybe a combination of both) here she was and there was nothing I could do about it now. The weeks leading up to the birth of her kittens, I actually became quite excited and decided that I would do everything in my power to find good homes and give them away free of charge. I had researched and birthing complications that Smoky might run into and I was completely prepared. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The night she went into labour was a night I’ll never forget. She began crying and breathing irregularly and I knew it was time. At first she tried to run under my bed, but I coaxed her out with a few treats. I didn’t want her to have them under there because I wouldn’t have had access to her if she had any problems. So I laid blankets and towels out in a small corner of my bedroom floor and she slowly crawled on top of them. I laid right beside her and just calmly patted her little head and spoke soft, supportive words. In a matter of twenty minutes she had had five beautiful little kittens. They looked little mice – tiny, wet, squeaking, crying, searching for milk. I looked at Smoky, who was exhausted but purring, pleased that it was all over. It was a beautiful experience and I’m glad that I was able to witness it.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Smoky was a great Mom, she pampered and cared for those kittens like no other animal I’ve ever seen. With seven cats and kittens, my house, to say the least, was pure pandemonium. However, I found great homes for four of them and I was actually quite sad to see them go. One of the kittens, Molly, was my favourite. She was extremely outgoing, and was kitten out of the litter to do everything first. She ventured out of my room first, jumped into my lap first, and was the first to hang off my living room curtains (something they all learned from her eventually). Molly and I had struck up quite the bond, and I had decided that I would keep her, bringing my cat total up to three. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Soon Molly began to pull the same whining bullshit when she saw the other two cats go outside and I ended up giving into her too. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Molly was five months old when she got hit by a car. I’ll never forget that night. I was up late working on a creative writing 1100 assignment and was extremely focused and determined to get it done. Around midnight I had decided to bring the cats in for the night. By 2am, Molly was still wide awake and started scratching and whining at the door. I had shouted at her a few times but she was determined to go back outside. I am one of those people who has to work in complete silence and the scratching was finally getting on my last nerve. So I let her out the door and continued working. About twenty minutes later, I heard cries from the street. I jumped up off my chair, put my shoes and coat on and rushed out the door. There, I found her. Laying on the road – her mangled body half crushed. I felt like I was in a nightmare, one of those dreams where your running from something and feeling so utterly helpless because you don’t know what’s chasing you. She was still alive, crying, suffering. I carefully picked up her deformed body and carried her into the house. I placed her down onto the kitchen floor and watched her try to get up but slump down in awful, heart-wrenching pain. I didn’t know what to do. I scrambled for the phone book and called an emergency vet. My boyfriend and I quickly drove her down while I held her in my lap, trying to choke back the tears. When we got there, it was obvious she wasn’t going to make it. The vet took X-rays and told me she had a crushed pelvis and internal bleeding. “We can try,” he said, “but it may cost a couple thousand and she may not even survive.” I held her in my arms while he gave her the injection. I kissed her soft little head and held her close as she drifted off into sleep. When I got back into the car, I just started sobbing. I cried hard, long and loud. I felt like I had lost a child and the pain was unimaginable. This was two years ago, but even writing this brings tears to my eyes. Losing Molly felt like phantom limb syndrome. The limb is gone, but you still have the sensation, still feel like it is still there. I had watched her come into this world, and I had watched her leave it as well.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;First of all, don't worry about rushing this, it was very well written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I was in tears reading this. Poor Molly, I'm so sorry you had to lose her like that. I have a cat of my own and you are right she is like a child to me. I don't know what I will do when she is no longer here. You truly were able to tug at my heart strings and create a vivid image of your connection with Molly and story.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I can really relate being around a ton of cats because we had a cat that had kittens and her kittens had kittens and it was chaos. I had a cat for 13 years that died and I have never been able to get that close to another cat again it sucks. Your story was well written with lots of detail. You did not fail to leave things out which made the story so good. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Good job. The narrative is robust, personal, and resonant. Now it's a matter of tightening things up a bit. Here are some words to put on your prohibited list:

few
some
finally (use eventually, instead)
just
never
few
you
it
everything
nothing
maybe

You get the idea. Try to use words that are more concise.

Look for (and correct) the improper use of &quot;your&quot; (you're).

Good, emotional ending, by the way (correct the tenses, though; use present).</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;My Beading Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Going under the theme: describe a humorous event in your life)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was very immature, no big surprise there, and I had a mega-attitude for my size. If my mother were angry with me, I would pout and roll my eyes until they ended up in the back of my head. Things have changed since then, trust me. But one instance in my life I took this immaturity a little to far. So far that now, 11 years later, I can do nothing but laugh at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One warm sunny day I was finishing up my ham and cheese sandwich in the kitchen and sipping on some raspberry Crystal Lite. Usually after finishing all my apple and banana slices, I would be rewarded with 2 double-stuffed Oreos for dessert. Today was not the case. My mother took away this frivolous privilege and gave me some cantaloupe instead. Little did I know this decision would end up completely awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so angry at her choice I marched into my room and closed the door behind me. My lack of Oreo intake that day seemed to have triggered a batch of oppressed anger from previous incidents such as this. I looked around my room for something I could use for revenge. Markers that didn’t have any tops to them, stray Barbie accessories to place around the house, something of that sort would do the trick. I had no such luck. Then upon glancing on an old beaded purse that was broken, a light bulb instantly lit up above my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a loose string of beads on this purse that needed to be sewn up. My mother, the crafty do-it-yourselfer, would save the day with no doubt in her mind that I was secretly getting revenge for her “unkind” acts from before. I decided that I would stick the beads up my nose and then get her to touch the snotty ones while fixing my purse. What a mistake that was. (I swear I wasn’t an evil child… just a little too creative)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up on my fourth bead when I snorted to hard. The green oval shaped bead was lodged somewhere that I, the experienced nose-picker, could not reach. This created a state of panic, as I ran out of my room to get my mother who helped me blow it out into a white Kleenex tissue. To this day I am thankful she didn’t ask any questions as to why there was a bead stuck up my nose. I think she knew my plan all along. &lt;/p&gt;Since then, I’ve learned to laugh at my mistakes as well as everybody else’s. Life’s lessons come in different forms, and mine came out of my nose. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>That was so funny, Kelsey. I felt like I was reading those funny little stories that people send in to Readers Digest Magazines. It was very well written, and like Timothy had stated, I really enjoyed the last line, too. It made me laugh. You're a great story-teller! </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Kelsey, I really enjoyed reading your piece. Like Timothy, it reminded me of all the mischievous (and sometimes awful things) I did to my parents when I was a little girl. One of the earliest memories I have is when I decided to stick a pussy willow (the little soft, fuzzy grey things on the ends of that type of tree) up my nose. I shoved it so far back that my mom had to take me to the local clinic and have it removed. I don't remember why I did it but, according to my mother, I wanted her to buy me a doll or something...Anyways, your easy going and comic voice really shines in this one, and I literally laughed out loud when I read your closing statement. Nice job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :) </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>A colorful and entertaining vignette. Suggestion: work on precision, on the removal of speechified words and phrases (as in the first sentence). Imagine that you are reading this to the literary jury of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Try to sharpen the focus of your vocabulary and narrative structure (the way your sentences sound) so that you say everything you need to say without using a single extra word or too many words that you might use in a typical conversation. In some ways, writing is a different language than speech.

                <MESSAGE>Wow, wow wow! I thought your story was amazing...I was essentially riveted when I read the first paragraph. Normally I wouldn't have read something that long, but I was captured. The emotions you described are so vivid, and the characters are so very interesting. I was curious once I finished it -- are you taking English or writing now? Aside from this class? It sounds like the thing you're most passionate about, and you're very good at it. And Chet sounds like a sweetheart :)</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a story I wasn't ready to tell in its entirety for over 10 years, and the writing made me wobbly, but I trusted that Ross would pick me up and dust me off if I passed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm planning on a psych major, but I've written, mostly poetry, off and on for years. I'm passionate about psych too, and fortunate that Kwantlen offers a lot of online classes in both. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hi Ross,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm having trouble figuring out which type of composition I should write for this first assignment. I have read all the info you have posted about Personal Essays and this was extremely helpful. Would you be able to post the same type of information on Memoirs and the Travelogue as well? I apologize if you have and I missed it. I'm hoping that the extra info might help me with narrowing down my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Sarah&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>This is merely my two cents, but I think it's best not to think about shoehorning a piece into a particular genre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to write from your own personal experience. Whether you use that to make a larger statement, as in a personal essay, or document your travels, as in a travelogue, it's all the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is, what do you care enough about to write down? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take care of the what, the how should become apparent. The how is the part you can most easily fix anyway. But if the what doesn't hold any life, no amount of tinkering with the how will resuscitate it.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Essentially, everything is a personal essay (which is why the content from me has that focus). A travelogue is you going somewhere (obviously, that's personal) and a memoir is about something that you remember (personal also). So, everything is a personal essay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't worry at all about genres. They are all arbitrary. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Thanks Tierney &amp;amp; Ross. I'm so used to having some sort of structure when I write a piece, especially an essay (even in my fiction crwr). It will be nice, for once, not to worry about structure or genre, and to just write from my heart without any limitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Just wondering what everyone thinks....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our tips from Ross is to write in the present because it isn't as confusing. But I am writing a travelougue this week and I think it would be better in past tense because I am writing about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which tense should I write in?&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Present tense is more immediate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a different feel. Try both on just one paragraph and read them out loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I'm writing the travelogue too Chantelle, and I definitely recommend present tense. It sounds a lot more personal, a lot more direct. Past tense is like the creative writing equivalent of passive language in journalism, I would imagine. It works to get the point across, but not very well. Present tense puts the reader into the story, while past tense will put up a barrier between reader and author that seems more like a dictation, rather than an experience. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, to echo the other comments: present tense is more immediate, reduces the likelihood of extra words, is more active, is simpler, and is (for all these reasons) more effective. Read the Scott Russell Sanders piece posted for this week (Under the Influence) to see how this is done: the eternal present of memory... </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I'm planning to write a piece about a friendship that was lost. I was friends with this girl since I was two but we had a falling out and haven't really spoken since (this was about 6 years ago). I usually prefer to write in present tense, but I feel that I would like to write about our growing up together (pieces of our lives from when we we're teenagers). So I would be in the present tense in certain areas but then going back and forth through past tense so I will be able to better describe the overall situation. Is this something that would work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah :)&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>This is one of the nagging afterthought sentences. I think it works well in past tense, just because it still seems direct, but I guess you guys can help and be the judges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than landing immediately, the pilot takes the plane on an aerial overview of the island, where, on this sparsely clouded November day, I catch my first glimpse of Central Park, Lady Liberty and the Empire State Building.

                <MESSAGE>Tenses can be immensely tricky, but one clue about tense conflicts is that they often indicate that you have not quite immersed the reader in the scene. Shifts in tense are a way of describing a scene. But you are not merely describing the scene; you *are* the scene. This may sound a bit abstract, but the writer's job is to make themselves invisible. You show the reader what's happening by getting yourself out of the way:

| Rather than landing immediately, the pilot takes the plane on an
| aerial overview of the island. On this sparsely clouded November day,
| I catch my first glimpse of Central Park, Lady Liberty and the Empire
| State Building. Perhaps the pilot is offering us a unique welcome to
| the city.

(You know, of course, that he was just following the flight path...)

Try to do less internal rumination (telling) and more showing. Thinking about this will, more often than not, get you out of the tense issue.

You are the scene.
You /are/ the scene.
You *are* the scene...

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was a little confused regarding this week's assignment...what is a travelogue? Presumably a memoir from a travelling experience? And what is the expected length of the composition? Roughly five-ish paragraphs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>The syllabus says there is no prescribed length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length prescriptions encourage wordiness and some awkward stretching to meet an arbitrary limit. Better to say what you have to say, then stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to quote Ross from another thread:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Essentially, everything is a personal essay (which is why the content from me has that focus). A travelogue is you going somewhere (obviously, that's personal) and a memoir is about something that you remember (personal also). So, everything is a personal essay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I don't worry at all about genres. They are all arbitrary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Take a look at the various responses to the genre question in this forum. About length: it's very difficult to write a good composition in five paragraphs. There are also various posts about the length of assignments (including one from the first week), so feel free to review those also. Basically: make it as long as it needs to be (which, typically, might be 2000-3000 words for this type of assignment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Ah, just saw Tierney's response. Couldn't have said it better myself.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I think I know what you mean. Something that not only conveys the pain of the end of the friendship, but that the end was really much earlier, and the cause she cites fairly irrelevant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it'll come to you in a day or two. These things have a way of working themselves out. You can't push the river. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me mad that Sonja got a two week detention. I was inwardly cheering for her. And I like the story overall -- I think you chose your subject well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hey all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been super busy this week and I don't know if I can get the whole thing on here for a draft and still have time to fix it. So I thought I would post a bit of it and I could get some tips. You know, see if I am on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out of John. F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, New York, I am overwhelmed by an awful smell. There aren’t any words to describe it, but believe me, it is bad. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As I leave the airport and start my journey toward the “City that Never Sleeps” I pass through the poverty stricken area known as Queens. There are people sleeping in cars, graffiti on virtually every wall and garbage overflowing in the cans. It boggles the mind to think that on the other side of the Queensborough Bridge is one of the richest cities in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But as I come up to the toll booth and first set eyes upon the ever-changing skyline of Manhattan I’m are awe struck the pure beauty. Windows sparkle in the sunset and I can’t help but wonder what the view looked like before changing forever. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My taxi comes to a stop in front of the famous Waldorf Astoria. The doorman opens my door with a smile and I step out looking up. That’s the first sign you’re a tourist in New York, the residents don’t walk down the street looking up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside is even more beautiful than I imagined. A grand staircase, carpeted in red and gold, leads up to the marble forayer. A large glass chandelier hangs high above the centre of the room. As I walk into the lobby I think I am walking into the smoking room on the Titanic. The walls were the same green and the large, plush couches are identical. I can picture Eric Braeden and Victor Garber (yes I’m picturing the movie) sitting with their pipes, discussing money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My room is nothing spectacular. All of these hotels are the same, beautiful downstairs where everyone can see. But you have to pay the big bucks to get the same in your room. Looking out my window I can’t help but smile. Between the boring brick buildings I see the Chrysler Building. The roof shining in the setting sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As night falls I make my way over to the General Electric Building at Rockefeller Centre. I know everyone says to go to the top of the Empire State Building at night, but I want to SEE it lit up. On my way up I am informed I am not allowed to use my tripod. Grumbling, I agree. I wonder how other photographers are able to take time exposures and avoid camera shake. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the elevator I feel like I am in a rocket. It takes off, music is playing and lights are flashing on the ceiling. I am on the roof within minutes. Now I can see why they don’t want you to use tripods. Anyone could trip over a leg and fall over the edge. You see, the GE building has no glass fence, it is merely a waist-high brick wall. The only glass exists on the corners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Later, turning in proves difficult. The sound of constant horns and sirens blasts through the open window. Tossing and turning proves futile, I kick off the sheets and turn off the TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early next morning I head for Central Park. I want to beat the afternoon rush and I don’t want to be there in the afternoon sun. Walking down the street I pass all of the shops I know I couldn’t afford anything in. Someday, I think, someday. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;em&gt;After collecting my luggage I head outside to get a taxi. Being in New York it is incredibly easy. Stepping out of the international arrivals it is hard to miss the long line of exhausted travellers standing beside a shorter line of bright yellow taxis. The only thing is I have to dodge the four lanes of other taxis, town cars and buses to get over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;And I have to say, writing this, I NEED to go back to NYC. It has been 2.5 years and I am dying to go back. YAY FOR DEC 2010 trip!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hey..this was cool. Your description of the little boy's drawing made me want to cry! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious...are you a photo journalist? Was this trip for your work, or just for pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>I'll echo Gillian's comment about the little boy's drawing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting thing is that we learn, indirectly, about your love of popular culture and the entertainment industry. I would have seen the city completely differently. Granted, I was a child when I went there, but my memories of New York center mostly around food -- mountainous Reuben sandwiches, dill pickles, and slices of pizza. No doubt they still would. Mmmmm, food. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also obvious that you're very auditory, because your descriptions are full of sounds and music. I like the detail about becoming acclimated to the noise. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hey Jillian,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am journalist and I do take pictures for my local paper. But I would LOVE to be strictly a photo journalist. I love to travel and I love to take photos. Best of both worlds :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUt this was purely a pleasure trip. Saw the sights with my folks and we're going again next year for christmas and new years :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;You're correct, I do LOVE pop culture and entertainment. Not only would I ove to be a photo journalist, but if I could be an entertainment reporter. Not ET style, that's just annoying. But I mean CD reviews, concert reviews, interviewing people when they come to town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to put that forward, as you picked up on, that this is how I saw NYC. NOt everyone will see the same thing. Like you saw food, we ate some local places, but I am not a big fan of HUGE sandwhiches or deep dish pizza. But we did eat at Sardi's, you remember that place with all the drawings? It was AMAZING!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Although this was a little shorter than the recommended 2000 - 3000 words, I really felt that the composition was finished. It just seemed to say, &amp;quot;Don't touch me&amp;quot;, when I reached the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So voila! Hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and happy V-day everyone!!)&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I like the surreal quality to this: the juxtaposition of the teenagers who don't want to be there, the over-the-top religiosity, the emotionally fragile frizzle-haired teacher (I love that you used an appellation throughout rather than her real name), and your internal experience of the beauty and solemnity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Hi Edmond, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed your story. Personally, I had a similar experience to yours, but I got lost in a shopping centre when I was 7. It was a horrible experience that I'll never forget, and I'm sure many of our classmates can recall a time when they got separated from their family members. Your story was very descriptive and so it was easy to visualize everything that was happening. Great job! &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>This was an interesting story...it was that fine line between comedy and tragedy. I had such a vivid image of a little girl trying to do laundry and cook...it was really adorable, and at the same time, it must have been terribly hard. I really liked this little snippet..thanks for sharing!</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Thanks for the feedback Gillian =) Since it was a personal story it was really hard to pick and choose what details to put in and whether or not I should add some more comedic points or keep it entirely serious. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I wrote almost three full and different drafts of this travelogue, none of which I was happy with. I ended up amalgamating parts of each, and it turned out looking like this. I decided against posting the nearly 7,000 words I initially wrote, and cut it down to about 2,500 so it wasn't a burden for you to read, and hopefully enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please read and hopefully enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Re: Revisions?</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>I just mean that all manuscripts, until published, are in a constant state of revision. Even after a manuscript is published there are possibilities for revision and improvement. So, I treat all of the drafts in this course as just that: drafts. I do not expect you to revise them in the context of the course, but I do think that you should consider various projects for this course as &amp;quot;drafts under review,&amp;quot; which might be used for later work and possibly publication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my comments regarding the projects are, obviously, intended to help with improving those projects; but the comments are made as illustrations, not directives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to re-submit something, that's perfectly OK. But you are not expected to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

You are a no-good ogre who kills innocent victims. Well, now it’s time for you to change your ways.” The princess slowly approaches the ogre and tells him to listen. “Ogre, why do you hurt innocent people? What have they done to you?” The ogre turns in the direction of the princess and says, “they shouldn’t be coming in &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; woods in the first place. “These aren’t just &lt;i style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; woods, replied the princess. The princess faces in the direction of the ogre’s back, and the unsuspecting ogre is stabbed in the back with a long knife. The ogre cries out in pain. “It’s time you got a taste of your own medicine,” replied the princess. The princess runs off leaving a helpless ogre laying in a pool of blood.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;“Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life, death is absolutely certain. What’s more,”… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I am bound for the eternal city, and if you kill me, I will still reach my destination. For murder is only an alternate path.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;At this, the ogre began to shudder. His toes clenched and unclenched in the mud as shivers passed up his legs, through his torso, and down his arms. The ogre was a creature that lived off of fear -- his existence was only guaranteed if he ate a trembling, palpitating, terrified heart each night. The ogre began to feel the press of insatiable hunger, and knew that the courageous heart of the princess would not satisfy him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;She appeared to him to be clothed in light. Radiant beams shot at his eyes from underneath her fingernails and through the thin tunic she wore. Her hair streamed out behind her in a light, ruffling breeze. The ogre fell to his knees, quivering -- feeling pangs of an unknown emotion rippling through his heart. She was unafraid. He became small, terrified in the beams piercing him from her eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The Ogre began to shrivel inwards, his skin tightening and sucking towards his core as the Princess stood triumphantly over him. With one final whimper, he vanished into a fine green dust that blew away in the cool twilight breeze. The Princess looked sideways to her broken weapons. She would no longer rely on these tools to conquer fear.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;“Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life, death is absolutely certain. What’s more, is that I have one more power that is more powerful than all five of my powers combined...and that is courage.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;With that, the Ogre looked stunned.  &amp;quot;How could a small princess be so fearless and so brave,&amp;quot; the Ogre thought to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; He again tried to attack her, but this time, the princess fought with a strength that the ogre had never seen before, for she had courage and did not fear death.  The Ogre had never experienced such raw passion, normally people ran the other way at the first sight of him.  This courage startled the Ogre so much that he backed off.  The Ogre was both in awe and dismay of the princess and decided to let her go as long as she promised to tell no one of her encounters with the Ogre.  The princess agreed, but after returning home, she denied the Ogre's request and told all of her stories.  This gave all the village people the determination and courage to not fear death for it is an inevitable part of life.  From then the Ogre was not feared.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

What’s more,”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the wisdom of the princess the ogre offered a truth between the two of them. The ogre asked the fair princess to teach him her wisdom. The ogre only knew how to kill he never learned how to be amongst humans. In return for knowledge he would grant her life and would not pulverise her tender white meat and make her into a good hearty stew for dinner that night. The princess intrigued by the ogres offer, not for the safety of her life but out of curiousity, agreed to teach the ogre until the day he was satisfied she would teach him everything she knows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years go by in the dark forest still uninhabited by anybody but the ogre and princess the princess still teaches the ogre. She teaches him why she believes the sky is blue, why courage is far stronger than might, and about love. As the princess tells of her tails of suiters being brought to her in the castle far from the caverns of the lushious forest she now can stand calling home. She speaks to the ogre of her father's disappointment that she will not settle for the finest richest men he has brought forth to her. She tells of how one must love before agreeing to spend eternity with one person. She speaks to the ogre of the passions she urns for and the companionship of her other half to know the depths of her heart and what makes her whole. As the princess tells of her quest for true love the ogre learns that he is falling in love with the princess and is disgusted with himself. With all the knowledge the princess has given the ogre he agrees that she deserves so much more and could never learn to love such a monstrousity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the ogre tells the princess that she has taught him all he needs to know and that she may leave as she pleases. The ogre learned about humanity and what love feels like and agreed to himself that this would be enough for him to allow humans through his forest without harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess packs her things and sets off the next morning waving hesitantly back to the ogre. She agreed to tell everyone she met of the kindness she found in the ogre and that he would no longer be dangerous to travellers of the forest. As she journeys farther from the forest and it becomes nothing more than a green blip in her vision she has told her story hundreds of times by know. Each time she tells her story her heart aches more and more until at last she stops and sits and never gets back up. The audience of her tale stare at the princess who just seemed to slow down like a dying clock. People from all over town try to snap the princess out of her trance or at least move her to shelter. But the princess was stuck by some unknown power and word travelled all over the lands. A shelter was built around the princess but they were unsure of how long she would last because she would not even eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People were no longer afraid of the dark green forest and travelled through it at their liesure. A group of young men set off to find the princess and awaken her. As the men chatted about how they plan to awaken the beautiful princess they unknowingly crossed paths with the ogre. The ogre did not like to make his presence known and even though he allowed humans access to his forest he never showed himself. Instead he would follow them along and listen to their tales, learning what he could because he urned for the communication he lost. When the ogre heard the story of the princess he set off at once to find her. After all she did for him he figured he owed her because even though he spared her life she gave him an even greater gift. As the ogre stepped out from the brushes of the forest people gasped. Even though the princess said he would not harm anyone they still ran away from the horrible beast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days later the ogre came upon a little shack made of brushes from ferns and lit by candle. As the ogre approached the hut he could feel his heart warm and knew that he had found her. The ogre was far too big for the tiny shelter so with one large hand he lifted the top of the hut and gazed upon his love. As his hand brushed the white of her cheek they instantly began to flush and she gazed into her friend, her companion, her other halfs eyes and in that instant she knew. The princess' heart could not bear the loss of her lover and turned off and now that he came for her she new that encased in the hairy grasps of the ogres arms is all she wanted for the rest of her life. In that instance of knowing the ogre swooped up his princess and took her back to her castle in the forest to live happily ever after. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Haha I loved this! It was so cute...and unusual in some ways! Typically in the &amp;quot;ogre falls in love with princess&amp;quot; stories, one or both parties change into a human or an ogre so that they're the same &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot; of creature. I liked that you left them just the way they are. It was sweet :)</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot;What’s more, in death, afterlife is an absolute certainty.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre was taken aback by the princess’ acceptance of an impending death. He stepped back from the princess and slunk down into a much less threatening version of himself, almost childlike in appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But I thrive on your fear,” the ogre said, shamed. But the princess didn’t believe a word of it. She maintained her readying attack pose, in case of any sudden retaliation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Well then your luck has run out, ugly beast,” she said. “It is because of simpletons and anarchists like yourself that give my life purpose. For I will be rewarded for my actions in the afterlife, and you will be eternally punished for yours.” The ogre, offended by her impassioned speech, took another step back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t enjoy what I do, but it’s my nature,” the ogre said. “I hate the killing aspect of my given lifestyle; rather, I take joy in watching my frightened victims turn submissive once they realize their attempts are futile. You can’t change the course of nature, foolish child. It is my destiny to be a merciless ogre, and it’s your destiny to be a warrior princess.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just then he ran into a large brambleberry thicket right off the edge of the path, where the princess could see him rustling around inside, the odd berry falling to the ground with the bush’s rumblings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre returned carrying a tattered, leather-bound book in his large hands. He approached the warrior princess, who was still in attack position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I won’t hurt you. This is my copy of the Old Testament. I get what you’ve been saying about actions and the afterlife, but…” The ogre quickly dropped the Bible and preceded to rip the princess’ head clean off before she could ever react. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There the ogre stood, holding the princess’ crown by her blond, bloody locks as if it were a trophy, her decapitated body slumped in a pile at his feet. “Like I was saying, don’t mess with nature. It’s my destiny to be an ogre, and it is your destiny to be a dead warrior princess.”&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did anybody else have a hard time writing the ogre as an evil being? Shrek has diluted my mind, and I can now only see an ogre as being a lovable Dreamworks character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's more, fear is nothing but a feeling. Something that can be overcome and conquered.&amp;quot; The princess said taking an attack position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The princess heard stories of the ogre as a child but never believed them. Each story revealed a different way to defeat the monster. The princess didn't want to kill him but, if it came down to it, she would have to. She was trained and as prepared as she ever could be. It was now or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You seem to think you have the power to defeat me,&amp;quot; the ogre questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know I have the power. I believe I can beat you and that is more powerful than all the training in the world,&amp;quot; the princess snapped back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The princess looked around at the weapons that lay around her, the sword was the closest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You must remember, the hand is quicker than the eye,&amp;quot; she dove for the sword. &amp;quot;And I am quicker than you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two combatants charged towards each other and their swords collided. The Princess delivered several hard-hitting blows but in one swift motion the ogre knocked her off her feet. He sword flew from her hands and landed feet away. The ogre moved to stand over her, he raised his sword in the air and prepared to kill her. He knew he could easily do it but something about the look on her face made him pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can kill me if you want. But know that others will come looking for me. You might be able to stop one but you can't stop a village,&amp;quot; she said calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ogre thought about what she said. If he let her live she would tell people of his softness and they would continue to come. But if he killed her, people would come to kill him. He decided that people passing by but ignoring him would be the lesser of two evils. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very well. Your wisdom has enlightened me. But hear this, if you speak of my sparing your life, you will suffer. I feel you are too wise and too swift an opponent to kill. Go now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The princess slowly crawled to her feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you. But you too are wise. I will keep your secret,&amp;quot; she said before turning on her heel and walking away forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot;O yea, then I will give u a fast and clean cut at your throat!&amp;quot;, the Ogre said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess and Ogre are running as fast as the lightening toward each other. In that split second, the weather is changing dramatically. There is strong wind blowing the dark clouds in. The sky turn so dark with thunder. It is insisting that there is something happening soon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ogre is attacking the Princess by his rusty axe. The princess closed her eyes with a smile. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ogre all the sudden disappeared. At that moment, there is a familiar voice coming from far. It is the young warrior. He transformed to be the Ogre and his that identity to test the Princess. He wants to see that if the princess is brave, confident, and strong. The princess did pass the test. She got the Five Weapons and also a white horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She named the white horse as Leonardo. Leonardo will protect her from now on and lead her the way to the eternal city. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>“Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life,&lt;br /&gt;death is absolutely certain. What’s more, I possess a secret weapon that's even stronger than death.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ogre chuckled, &amp;quot;You've tried all of your weapons and failed, your sixth shall surely fail as well.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, her crimson lips released a devastating &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot;, which cut threw the cold air like an arrow. It screeched into the Ogre's ears and immediately penetrated his poor defenseless heart. He fell powerless to the ground, clutching his chest. A look of sheer terror cemented to his face, as pale as a sea-sick sailor. The pitiless princess, casually walked to his side and wrapped her serpentine arms around his, pulling him to his feet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I'm going to the eternal city now honey,&amp;quot; said the princess. &amp;quot;Would you like to come with me?&amp;quot; The words further bound him with every syllable like straps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the ogre could process her words, he felt his lips moving, almost as if they were no longer his,&amp;quot;Yes dear,&amp;quot; he whimpered, realizing he was doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they walked off into the sunset. The heart of the heart-eater, firmly in the possession of the devious little warrior princess. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>“Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life, death is absolutely certain. What’s more, if I turn back now, I shall eventually die. If I give up my battle with you, I will die. Since I cannot escape death, I would rather follow this path.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre stood still and spoke again. &amp;quot;You were warned by your friends at the first trees where your path would lead. Yet you continued, knowing your fate.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nay,&amp;quot; replied the princess. &amp;quot;They were not my friends. They did not know me therefore they do not know of my practices, my virtues. They had false views and if I were to believe them, I would have been unfaithful to myself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre laughed and cracked the knuckles of his giant claw of a right hand. &amp;quot;The foolishness of youth,&amp;quot; he cried. &amp;quot;Do you not believe me, an ogre you see before your very eyes?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess stood her ground. &amp;quot;I see you as I also see my path. Because there is a path, it must be possible to pass by you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre laughed again and picked up one of the princess's damaged weapons from the floor of the forest. &amp;quot;But princess, you have used all your weapons against me and you still have not succeeded.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess smiled at the ogre and asked, &amp;quot;Ogre, I am asking you to pass.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre said nothing. The silence grew an hour-old before the ogre spoke again. &amp;quot;Princess, I will let you pass if you give me one thing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess replied, &amp;quot;What is it you want, ogre?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ogre had a greedy glint to his eye as he grinned. &amp;quot;Princess, I want your youth.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the princess already knew her youth would be spent on the path so she granted the ogre his wish and she continued to the eternal city, a place where the months and years had no meaning. </MESSAGE>

If I am to die, so be it, I have lived my life with the truest of intents and shall be rewarded as such in the afterlife. You on the other hand, have dedicated your life to wreaking havoc on many and basking in death and mutilation. While I am spending eternity in peace, you shall suffer an eternity of the horrors you yourself have administered.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You lie,” said the ogre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I am not here to convince you either way, it is for you to find out what may come,” replied the princess, who calmly approached the creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The princess’ cool demeanor angered the ogre, and he seized her in his arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I am ready for the eternal city,” she said as she closed her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, the ogre crushed her in his arms and devoured her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;even if you were to eat my heart, you would wake tomorrow more empty and lonely than you are today. Yours is a hunger that cannot be sated with hearts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The ogre's eyes narrowed. &amp;quot;Youth, you are naive and stupid. With every heart I consume, I grow stronger and more fearsome.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But the warrior princess just looked at the ogre. The longer she did this, the angrier the ogre became. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He let out a tremendous bellow, but the princess did not budge. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He charged the princess, but she did not flinch. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then a curious thing happened. A hint of fear flickered in the ogre's face, and then the tiniest of tears formed at the corner of his eye. Then more and bigger tears. The more he cried, the younger and less grotesque the ogre became. He fell to the ground and put his arms around his knees and wailed into them, until at last he looked like a tiny boy of no more than three or four years. The ogre-boy began to gasp for breath and cease his crying.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The princess knelt beside the little boy. He pulled away. &amp;quot;Please don't hurt me,&amp;quot; he begged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Of course not,&amp;quot; the princess said to him. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Please don't leave me here in the forest. It's scary at night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Of course not,&amp;quot; said the princess. &amp;quot;But how did you come to live in the forest in the first place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;My Daddy left me here. He said he would come back before nightfall, but he never did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;And you became a big strong ogre to take care of yourself?&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boy wiped his tears away with the back of his sleeve. &amp;quot;Uh-huh.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I see,&amp;quot; said the princess. &amp;quot;I can take you back to my teacher, and he will teach you everything he taught me, but you must make a promise first.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The little boy looked up at her, his eyes full of hope. &amp;quot;What's that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No more ogre.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No more ogre. Promise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At that, the princess picked him up and put him on her horse and took him back to the kingdom, where he learned everything the princess knew -- the five weapons and the forty-two virtues -- everything, including the courage to defeat heart-eating ogres. &lt;/p&gt; </MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;“Ogre,” replied the princess. “Why should I be afraid? For in life, death is absolutely certain. What’s more,”… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She continued “My weapons would all be useless if my use of them was backed by fear.” She locked eyes with the ogre, her gaze never changing. She knew at that moment that it was not the power of the 5 weapons which she used so flawlessly that would protect her, but rather the forty-two virtues which she had learned along her way to their mastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ogre returned her stare, unsure of what to do next. “You were warned by other travellers to not venture forward” he said, charging at her again with the force of a lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I did as everyone else,” the princess replied, easily dodging his charge, “I would not have earned my title. Keep trying to wear me down all you like, I will not back down.” Her determination frustrated the Ogre who continued to run at her, completely blinded by his fury as she side stepped him every time. The princess remained patient as she backed up slowly. Not once did she allow the ogre to touch her. She thought out every move and always remained one step ahead of the ogre who merely reacted without thought. She focused on remembering her virtues in order to stay calm and not give in to the ogre. She stepped backwards slowly, careful and diligent with each step. When she finally reached the furthest point of the forest, the point where the floor gave way to a thousand foot drop, she steadied herself, allowing the ogre to get closer and closer. The ogre, overwhelmed with his greed and frustration failed to notice the drop and lunged at her. His fiery eyes glowed as he grazed her body. At just the right moment, the princess slid out of the way and the ogre catapulted over the edge. The princess glanced down the ravine, remaining emotionless, and then continued on her journey to the eternal city. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

The sun shone brightly here and the stream ran fresh.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;...a little green box that seemed to have something in it. After prying the little green box open with a stick, the boy was amazed by what he found inside. Diamonds, jewels and gems in every color imaginable filled up to the rim of the box. The boy looked around to see if anyone was watching him, and thankfully, nobody was. He quickly put handfuls of the shiny stones in his jacket and pants pockets and then carefully put the little green box back into the chest and put it back exactly where he found it. The boy paused for a minute and then started to run as fast as he could to the nearest pawn broker to make some quick cash. The boy did not realize how valuable the stones were until the man at the pawnbroker estimated its worth at over a few million dollars. Without hesitation, the man asked the boy if he would like to sell the diamonds, jewels and precious gems to him for a big price. The boy agreed and walked off with his cheque. That day changed the boy’s life forever. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;In the chest, the boy saw absolutely nothing.  The boy looked in dismay, wondering why someone would hide a treasure box with nothing in it.  Just as he was about to turn away, he saw a note stuck to the side of the box.  He read the note aloud, &amp;quot;Give the key to the next face you come upon and the treasure will be his.&amp;quot;  The boy did not think this was fair, why should someone else, a stranger no less, be awarded with the treasure?  After all it was him who did all the work of finding the key and digging up the treasure box.  The boy thought of a plan, he could plan it so that the next person he passed was a friend, and then when the friend attained all the treasure they could split it.  He walked along the path that he knew his good friend John would be walking along.  As he passed John, he gave him the key and explained his plan.  But when John returned to the treasure box, and opened it he found nothing.  Frustrated, both of the boys threw the key on the ground and stormed off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, another boy passed along, found the key, dug for the treasure box, found the note, and read it.  This girl did exactly as the note said, and passed along the key to the next stranger she saw.  Immediately the girl was awarded with not one but three boxes of treasure, and the stranger was awarded with one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the little boy making the fire, had only listened to the note and not have been so selfish, he would have been rich.  Selfishness never gets awarded.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>In the chest the boy saw the remains of a small animal. It might have once been a kitten or an underdeveloped puppy, or it was even large enough to be a weasel. It was likely the latter, because the land on which he now stood is infested with the rodents during the summer and harvest seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“But why would the bones be in a box buried in the ground?” the boy wondered to himself. The snow, still falling hard, was past the 8-year-old’s neck, but he had scraped away a space large enough to avoid the 4-foot snow bank. Huddled over the box, the boy removed the red mitten from his right hand. The chill instantly stung as the wool mitt slid off his fingers. But he blocked out the pain and nudged the remains aside with his colourless fist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peaking out from just below the pile of ribs and cartilage, the boy could see the corner of a damp piece of paper. He slid the body parts aside and picked up the paper, stuck to the bottom of the iron chest. He tried unfolding it, but his left mitten was getting in the way, so he removed it too and opened the paper to see what was written on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was small and barely decipherable. There was a map at the bottom of the page. The snow was falling hard and landing right on the paper, making it almost impossible for the boy to read it. He unzipped his large winter jacket and held it over the paper to shield it from the snow so he could read. Freezing cold, the child’s hands were shaking violently, and that was making it even harder to read the note. The boy could make out the words ‘treasure’ and ‘fortune’ amid the poor writing and shivering fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh boy, a treasure map!” the child exclaimed loudly in delight. He could see a thick plume of his breath against the winter air disappear into the cold afternoon. “This is so exciting.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boy’s father found him lying underdressed and motionless next to the box almost three hours later. He was curled up tight, clutching the piece of paper in a ball in his exposed right hand, only 200 yards from his front porch. The coroner said the child died quick, but painfully, of hypothermia and frostbite that cold winter afternoon. The ink from the letter was smudged illegible by the drenching of snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>And the boy found...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small plant, slowly unfurling its leaves in the rich, fecund soil at the bottom of the box. The boy was immediately disappointed. No treasure? No gold&lt;br /&gt;coins or rubies? He nearly threw the box away in his disappoint, but finally closed it half-heartedly and put it in his pocket to take home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The boy was from a poor family who lived in a cottage on the fringe of a large city. He had only a Mother, for both his Father and sister had died&lt;br /&gt;last winter from a mysterious sickness. The boy put the plant near his bed and opened the box lid. He forgot about it for most of the winter, yet still the plant grew in the feeble winter light from the window. When the snow had all melted and the birds were beginning to sing, the boy remembered the plant, and was astonished. Not only was it still alive, but it looked better than when he had found it! The leaves had taken on a strange golden tinge, and small purple berries were sprouting in clusters underneath the fronds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The boy's Mother gradually grew ill as the spring wore on. She would spend most of the day on a small, flat cot near the stove, trembling. The boy's Mother wove baskets from reeds she found near the river, but because she was so sick, she could not work. The family could not afford to buy food, and the few chickens that they did have died from an unknown blight. The boy himself grew thin, wan, and always ferociously hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Only the plant grew in the household, even though the boy no longer watered it. In the summertime, the plant had grown so tall that it began to scrape against the roof of the family hut. By the end of the summer, the plant had burst through the roof entirely, creating a gaping hole that caused the rest of the roof to  rot inwards. Not only did the plant grow tall, but it became wide. Its trunk was as large as a tree, and the berries on the plant were now as large as ripe peaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;At the onset of fall, the boy knew that he and his mother would die very soon if they did not have any food. Timidly, he approached the plant, plucked a purple fruit, and ate it. He felt better instantly, and took a fruit to his Mother as well. She immediately got up off her cot and began to clear away the rubble of the rotten roof from the cottage floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The plant continued to grow, and it soon filled the entire cottage, surrounding its occupants with a leafy, green warmth. The boy and his Mother continued to eat the purple fruit, and they grew tall and strong. Next winter, the boy did not even have to collect firewood, because the arms and fronds of the plant produced a near tropical warmth in the delapidated walls of the hut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Soon, the walls of the hut crumbled and fell, and only the vast plant remained, surrounding the boy and his Mother in a jungle-like paradise. The boy fashioned a  doorway into the vine cottage, and soon villagers from the nearby city came to visit the miraculous home. Everyone was in awe, and tasted the miraculous purple fruit, which appeared to heal all ailments instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;One day, the King from the city came to visit the vine cottage. He had been suffering from a severe leg cramp for the past several years, and was in such pain that he could hardly rule the city. The boy offered him a purple fruit, and upon eating it, the King was freed from all pain. The King was so grateful that he said to the boy, &amp;quot;Son, I want to give you something for helping me. Ask for anything, up to half my kingdom, and it will be yours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The boy thought for a moment, then looked at him and replied, &amp;quot;Gracious King, thank you for your offer, but I have everything that I need here. The plant gives me food and shelter, what more could I possibly want? It is the most valuable treasure I will ever possess.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The End&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Then he turned the lock once,the lid popped open, and in the chest the boy saw glimmering diamonds, painting his face with their reflected light. They were as clear as ice, and their glow danced as he ran his fingers through the chest. Some of the diamonds were as big as a baby's fist, others as intricate as a snowflake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;There must be millions of dollars in here!&amp;quot; he thought. He carefully closed and clasped the lid. He rocked the heavy chest back and forth until it jumped onto his sled, and slowly he dragged the treasure with his tired little arms back to his father's broken-down cabin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Papa! Papa! Look what I've found!&amp;quot; squealed the little boy. His father set down his newspaper and turned the tiny key. His eyes were illuminated by the wondrous diamonds and a tear drizzled down his ecstatic cheek. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What are we going to do with the money papa?&amp;quot; asked the boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I reckon it's your choice son, since you found it an' all,&amp;quot; replied his father, full of wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; said the boy, a look of hard concentration on his face. &amp;quot; I've grown tired of always fetching wood from that goddamned forest. Let's invest in a forestry operation and clear-cut every tree. After that, lets fund an open-pit mine to fully exploit the rest of our land.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The father gazed down at his son, full of pride. </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>In the chest the boy saw...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chest the boy saw a vast field surrounded by trees. At first he thought the box was a diorama but the wind began to blow and the trees swayed. The smell of the Douglas Firs rose from the box and met the boy's nostrils. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath to savour the smell. When he looked back down he saw wild horses run through the field, their thunderous hooves drowning out the sounds around the boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the horses passed an army of soldiers walked into the field. The leader of the group stopped and looked up at the boy. He felt a warm breeze come from directly above him after the boy took a deep breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You there. How did you discover this land?&amp;quot; asked the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy was shocked the man could talk, but couldn't hear a word he said. He leaned in further to hear the man repeat what he said. As he did he slipped into the chest and landed right next to the soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What did you say?&amp;quot; he asked as he got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I asked how you cam upon our land. And why did you fall from the sky?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I didn't fall from the sky. I fell into a chest, this is a chest I found in the snow,&amp;quot; the boy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldier looked confused. This world was vast and it would take years to cover it all, how could it be confined to a chest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It seems this chest you speak of is a portal between our worlds. What is yours like?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy didn't know what to say. He didn't like the world he lived in. His parents were killed when he was very young and he spent the years since in foster homes. Some of them better than other, but most of them weren't nice at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing like this world. Mine is dark, wet and cold. Yours is beautiful, colourful and bright. I would love to stay here with you, the people in my world aren't nice at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Young lad, every world has a dark and cold area. At times you may think it is never going to change, but it is important to remember to look for the light. If this world is the light you seek you may visit as often as you wish. Or simply remember us here and allow it to brighten your world. Now, you must return to your world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldier took the boy by the arm and thrust him into the air. He flew six feet into the sky and landed on the snow covered ground where he once stood. The boy was shaken up but the soldier's words resonated in his mind. Maybe there was a brighter side to things, maybe sometime his world would change into the field he longed to be in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bent over and closed the lid to the chest. Smiling, he picked it up and carried it with him as returned from the way he came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Then he turned the lock once, the lid popped open, and in the chest the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boy saw his mother float out of the box. The boys mother died last &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;winter in an alcohol related car accident. Shocked by what he was &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seeing he threw the box and stuck his head in the frosty snow sobbing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;convulsively. The spirit of his mother floated towards the boy and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stroked his golden curls like she used to do every night before bed. The &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boy still sobbing turned his frozen face towards his mother once again &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and made himself look at her. She was more beautiful than he remembered &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with silky blond hair that curled slightly at the bottom and robed in &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;matching silky white garments. She must be freezing the boy thought to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;himself but instead of shivering his mother just smiled at him as if she &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;new what he was thinking and stretched out one sparkling hand towards &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;her son. The boy hesitantly placed his hand into his mother. His skin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tingled against hers and was surprisingly warm. She then urged her son to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get up and walk with her. Knowing that he should listen to his mother he &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got up and shook his icy legs free of there stiffness. Elegantly the two &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of them floated across the snow barely leaving a footprint behind them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the boy new it he was in front of a glowing light. His mother &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bent down kissed her sons head and smiled once again. The boy had so &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many questions but it was as if the winter froze his mouth shut &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and he could not talk to his mother. A sound from the distance grabbed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the boys attention and he looked towards it. He could make out the sound &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of his father's voice yelling his name. He turned back to his mother to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see what he should do and as he looked back she was gone. The boy sad &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from his loss again fell to the ground. Moments later he was swooped up &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by hard warm arms. His father had been searching for him for over an &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hour and was terrified he lost him to. He took his son into the warmth &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and laid him by the fire just staring at him warm himself praying that &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he would never lose him like he lost his wife. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Once in the wintertime when the snow was very deep, a poor boy had to go out and fetch wood on a sled. After he had gathered it together and loaded it, he did not want to go straight home, because he was so frozen, but instead decided to make a fire and warm himself a little first. So he scraped the snow away, and while he was clearing the ground he found a small golden key. Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also be a lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest. “If only the key fits!” he thought. “Certainly there are valuable things in the chest.” He looked, but there was no keyhole. Finally he found one, but so small that it could scarcely be seen. He tried the key, and fortunately it fitted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he turned the lock once, the lid popped open, and in the chest the boy saw a metal plate. Inscribed on the metal plate were curious symbols - lines, dots and curves aligned in straight rows across the dull surface. The boy turned the plate in his hands, finding on the reverse side, the self-same symbols in patterns. They were in groupings, matched with others to form mountains and valleys on the plate. The lines of symbols were shiny, as if the creator of the plate had run his fingers across the metal as the boy did now. &amp;quot;This new key is valuable,&amp;quot; the boy thought. The golden key rested in the iron chest, gleaming dully in the reflected fire light. The metal plate shone in his hands, the symbols bright under his eyes. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Then he turned the lock once, the lid popped open, and in the chest the boy saw a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book had no title, and the boy was disappointed in his find, not bothering to open its pages. He had hoped for jewels and riches, and had found nothing more than a ragged book. It was even colder than before, so the boy quickly built his fire and sat in front of it in hopes of keeping warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the wind whipped, the book flew open. The boy looked at it in disdain and threw it onto the fire. As the fire consumed the book, a small piece of one of the pages floated from the fire, and landed on the snow in front of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It read: Herein lies the location of Arthur’s treasure-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the boy realized his mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Then he turned the lock once, the lid popped open, and in the chest the boy saw a gold necklace. The light of the fire caught the gold and the necklace seemed to be a living, breathing thing. The boy stared at the necklace for quite some time as he had only dreamt about precious metal and its existence was a doubtful thing until now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was late afternoon and the temperature was dropping and the boy started getting numb from the cold. He lifted the necklace from the box and slid it clumsily around his neck. The necklace felt warm and amazingly, that warmth tingled through the rest of his body from his eartips to toetips. The boy patted the necklace through his jacket and used the box to scoop snow onto the fire to put it out. The boy then dug a hole in the snow and placed the box with the key into it and covered it back up. As he trudged back to his home with the heavy sled that tugged on his poor arms, he thought about how much nicer it would be if the sled were lighter. As soon as the boy thought this, the sled did indeed become lighter. The boy's eyes grew wide with excitement and possibilites. He dreamed of the food he wanted to eat when he got home, food he'd heard about from children in his village who talked about what was eaten in far-away castles. He thought about all the things he wanted and he wished, patting his necklace through his wool jacket, those things would be waiting for him when he walked into the front door of his home. After stacking the wood, he walked into the cabin and excitedly asked his mother what his family was having for dinner. His tired mother looked at him curiously before telling him that it was the usual helping of potato soup and a heel of bread. The boy then raced to his sleeping quarters with the expectatation of new trinkets. There was nothing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boy was disappointed and angry with the necklace, yanked it off and threw it on his cot. It slid across the thin blanket and to the wooden floor. The boy's thoughts were consumed with the disappointment with necklace that night. He woke up from his sleep angry the next day and that anger, rather than subsiding, grew stronger into weeks and months. The next wintertime arrived and the snow was again very deep and the boy had to go out and fetch wood. He remembered how the necklace had kept him warm and the wood, lighter, so he fished around under his bed until he found it again. He slipped it around his neck and when his mother hugged him, he looked at her with bitterness and wished she would be covered with warts for not being able to provide him more to eat that potato soup and heels of bread. When he slammed the door to the family's small wooden house when he left, he wished it would burn down. He trudged into the woods, not noticing his mother's screams and the smell of burning wood. He wished he would not have to work and for the sled to already be full of chopped wood and the boy was surpised to see it was just so. He tried using the necklace again, wishing that he would grow two feet taller and he did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boy realized that, in order for the necklace to work, he had to be touching the very thing he was wishing would change at the same time. He remembered his last thoughts with horror as he left the house and ran back to see that it was fully engulfed. The boy held his necklace and tried to touch the fire, wishing for it to go away. But fire is a difficult thing to grab onto and the boy couldn't. With a cry of anguish the boy fell into a heap, tearing away the necklace and throwing it into the heat of the flames. </MESSAGE>

He slid the material through his fingers and twisted the tassles on the end of the scarf. Although frozen to the bone, he got up, with scarf in hand and trekked home, wanting to share his . Coming upon his house, he heard a voice, a groan, come from behind the bushes beside him. He stopped walking and stood silent and still. He slowly turned his head towards the bush, listening intently for another sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ghmmmmughhhhhh,&amp;quot; another muffled groan came from the brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy turned and stepped towards the sound. He looked through the leaves and found a man curled into himself, shivering laying in the snow. He looked up at me and saw the scarf and said, &amp;quot;Where did you find this... Why do you have it? I need to get back home! Please give it to me. NOW!&amp;quot; and he held out a transparent white hand and grabbed hold of the tassles and yanked it off my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's eyes were wide with shock. He had a bald head and a wrinkly face. His eyebrows were raised and many thought lines collected on his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy hadn't said a word when a faint voice interuppted his train of thought. It was his mother calling from his house awaiting the boy's arrival. He turned his attention towards the house for a moment and then swiveled his head back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He glanced down and the man had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Very interesting. Notice how, at one point, you become the boy.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;a smooth round stone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Why would someone bury this in a box?&amp;quot; the boy puzzled to himself. &amp;quot;No matter, it must have some value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;He took the stone and slipped it in his pocket. Once he had warmed himself, he put out the fire and continued his journey home. As he walked, he fingered the stone in his pocket, turning it round and round as he turned the question round and round in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;When he returned home, his father asked him why he had been so long fetching wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I was cold and made a fire to warm myself,&amp;quot; he tried to explain, but his father grabbed the switch and began to beat him with it. When he crawled into bed without having supper, his bottom sore and his stomach empty, he turned the stone round and round and pondered its purpose until he fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;As the years passed, the boy was often cold and hungry. Day after day, when he wished to be anyhow other than how he was, he daydreamt of the stone's purpose. Over the years, it grew shiny with wear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;As boys eventually do, he grew into a young man. He courted a girl from the village. He thought of the stone less and less, but continued to keep it in his pocket and turn it from time to time. He toyed with it as he waited to ask his girl to marry him. He clenched it tight as he waited for his daughter to be born. While they did struggle from time to time, there was always food on the table, and a fire on the hearth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;One day, he took his daughter to the creek to catch their dinner. He had always thought of his stone as special, but it suddenly occurred to him that here were thousands just like it. He smiled to himself, and began to search the creek bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;He spotted a pretty rose-colored stone with a white stripe through it that he thought the right size for his daughter's palm, and called her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Close your eyes and hold out your hand,&amp;quot; he said to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;She did as he asked, and he placed the stone in her hand. &amp;quot;Now open.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;It's a rock, Daddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;I know,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But it's a very special rock.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;But why, Daddy? What makes it so special?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;quot;I can't tell you. It would spoil the secret,&amp;quot; he said to her. &amp;quot;But someday, I bet you'll figure it out.&amp;quot; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>why is a subject field always required?</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Somehow with aging, the writing process seems to become more complicated. I wrote my first story when I was six. It was about a goose that a hunter shot while it was flying. When I was six, I didn't know that geese can't fly -- I drew a scrabbly little picture on the bottom of the page of a bloody dead goose in a field. It was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, things got more complicated. A strange sense of awareness kicked in -- I started to wonder what other people would think of my stories. So I started writing about Barbies and Nintendo characters, because that was what kids my age did at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time high school rolled around, writing was not the cool thing to do at all. So I stopped writing -- simple. It wasn't a conscious choice, rather, other things began to fill my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, the strangest thing happened. I was in my first year at college, and I was waiting at a bus stop. I was looking at the clouds, cursing the impending rain, when I saw a group of birds flying in a V. It just hit me all of a sudden. I wanted to be a writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection, it is strange how epiphanies come. After reading this week's material, I would say that I am somehow emerging from the &amp;quot;labyrinth&amp;quot; into a sort of clarity. I am beginning to look backwards into the past, and see the narrative emerge. A voice that I didn't know I had is beginning to blossom. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Well, actually (most, all?) geese can fly. Think of the Canada Goose, for example. Thousands of miles of flying every spring and summer.

And I bet those V-flying birds you saw at the bus stop were geese!

Nice to hear about your sense of emerging voice. That's what it's all about. Your Voice. With a capital V.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I feel kind of dumb now. I haven't thought about geese in a long time. I was envisioning the big farm geese...the gross noisy ones that poo everywhere, when I was talking about non-flying birds. Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now that the V birds are geese, the tale is just complete!&lt;/p&gt;

                <SUBJECT>The Creative Process...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> It's February 25 and it's snowing outside like it was in December, before Christmas...big, soft, fluffy flakes that look like white cotton candy falling from the dark grey sky above. I'm sitting here in front of my computer, about to write this reflection. I've had a tough couple of weeks. Just started a second job. Stressed out about my Math midterm that I just had today. I think I failed it. I didn't feel confident with any single answer I produced. The truth is, I've never been good at Math. It's like my brain just doesn't want to function when there's a set of math problems in front of me. If there's such a thing as Math dyslexia, then I have it. I'll read, study, practice, practice and practice some more but it just doesn't sink in and most of the time I feel retarded. Oh, and another thing...and this may sound a little immature but...please, please tell me why I have to learn algebra and quadratic equations to teach grade two children? I'll be teaching the fundamentals: basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, how to count and identify money, etc, etc. I guess what frustrates me the most is that I have never really had to work this hard on something my entire life, and the thickening stress consumes me much of the time.&lt;br /&gt; However, when I write, I can let all that pent up stress flow out my finger tips and into the keyboard. I will just write, write, and write. I try not to look up at the page and just focus on the letters and words that miraculously mess together like the colors of a finger painting. Whether the finished product is a great piece of work is not my concern. I just write, and just like how painting a picture relaxes some people, writing is my destressor, my outlet, my time away from being a Dyslexic Math retard.&lt;br /&gt; I remember my first teacher who got me to love writing. I was in grade three and her name was Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson had a red, round, chubby face that was slightly too big for her body and she was an insightful, warm, caring, and wonderful teacher. Her life passion was teaching, and it was obvious every single day. Last week, my Mom actually bumped into her at the grocery store and she is sixty-seven and still teaching grade three at the same school. She used to call me her &amp;quot;little author,&amp;quot; because she truly believed that I was destined to write books. &lt;br /&gt; Grade three was the year when my mom's boyfriend became physically abusive. He was only verbally abusive to me. Used to call me a &amp;quot;fat whale.&amp;quot; I was nine, and maybe ten pounds overweight. Most nights they would argue and shout at each other, and my mom would take an occasional rough slap on the face. Those rough slaps turned into shoves, punches, kicks...and many nights I had to call my Grandma because she was so battered and bruised. At school, Mrs. Johnson made us write in a journal every morning. Even though I was worried about all the problems at home, I didn't want anyone to know about it. Instead, I would write from my vast imagination, writing epic stories of princesses and princes, white unicorns that I would ride off into a land of tranquility and eternal happiness. Soon, I was writing in my own journal, a diary I received as a Christmas present that year. It was a pink Strawberry Shortcake (dolls back in the eighties), and had a little gold lock on the front of it. Knowing that I could lock it up and that no one would read it, I wrote about my life each day. That little diary soon became my therapy, and I still have it tucked away in my book shelf somewhere.&lt;br /&gt; I wrote in a diary up until I was sixteen. Not every day, but I would would try to write in it every week at least. Senior years of high school were a whirlwind of rebellion, drugs, and drinking, and, like Gillian, I stopped writing for several years during that time.&lt;br /&gt; It was only until university that I started writing again. Not only for classes, but I started a new diary as well. It doesn't have a lock on it, but I'm older now and I realize that being a domestic abusive victim isn't shameful or embarrassing. I write because I love it. I love the high I get from splattering words onto a page and letting my feelings and emotions fall out of me like the cotton candy-like snow that's still falling at this very moment. &lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, writing is a kind of therapy, and a balm, and a gateway, and anything we can deliver to the doorstep of the imagination. Which amounts to everything.

A good, honest post. Well done.

Yes: why the hell is it snowing again?

And: read The Myth of Ability

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading your post! You had a lot of great descriptive detail that was evident throughout the piece. I actually had a teacher with a really round, red face... it brought back a lot of memories, most not so good - but oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to relate the snow to a writers block... it can sometimes be thick and can create a lot of stress. When you think it's gone and you go about your day like usual, it starts right back up again when you least expect it... &amp;quot;ARGH!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Emotions is directly related to personal experience</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> As I read more essay and books, I find that personal experience is a very important component of a piece of writing. A person without life experience and history does not give a dynamic view on things and events. The emotion may be flat that give no color to the writing at all. Therefore, a good writer should be a person with lots of life experience and not hesitate to try new things that come up in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was an ordinary guy who never liked to try new things or go to new places that I was not familiar with. The reason was that I did not like the feeling of failure. When I was eight, my parents suggested me to join the boy scout. They said that I could gain more self confident through group activity and learn problem solving. From that point on, I liked to try new things, explore new ideas, work with others, and be creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In school, I do also notice there is a change in my thoughts and writing style. I tend to put in more personal feelings and experiences in my writing. My writing is becoming more personal and authentic. In future, I wish to go travel in more countries to broaden my eyesight and creative mind.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>My Thoughts...</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I have heard the following saying numerous times throughout my life: &amp;quot;It is best to write about things you know.&amp;quot; I completely agree with this statement, especially when it comes to writing in non-fiction. When I know something, or have gone through a certain experience/experiences in my life, I am able to express ideas, convey meaning, and articulate emotions and feelings in a much more proficient manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it quite strange that the topics I write about are highly influenced by the weather the day I am writing. It is odd because when it is raining outside, I tend to write depressing stories, such as the time I got stuck in an elevator and when it is sunny outside, I tend to write about the pleasant memories of my life, such as the time I got to go to an amusement park in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it is interesting to see how much my writing has improved since grade school. Just recently, as I was cleaning up my room, I came across several duotangs filled with my writing of fiction and non-fiction stories from Grades 3 and 4. As I read a few sentences from each page, I could not help but laugh because the writing was weak and it was not written in a very sophisticated manner. The non-fiction stories were very dull and were lacking imagery and filled with grammatical errors. In no way was I expecting a masterpiece, (especially at the Grade 3-4 level), but I was amazed at how far I have come over the years. Looking back at my writing from Grades 3 and 4 made me realize that writing in a skillful manner is a lifelong process and my writing skills will only continue to develop the more I read and write. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I completely agree with what you wrote in your third paragraph. Seeing as how I'm a girl and I like to save some of my creative work that I've done throughout grade school, it's amazing to see the changes in my writing throughout elementary, high school and university. Although most third graders have no idea how to emphasize in great detail and elaborate on their ideas, I find it so fascinating to see how little time it took for me to develop my own creative voice and style of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great piece!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>About improvement: it's the reading, as much as the writing, that makes a difference. Reading shows you what's possible; writing encourages you to do it. Also: my experience has been about a 10 percent increase in skill per decade (since I was twenty). I had a sudden 30 percent increase about five years ago, but otherwise it has been a slow and steady process.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I've already mentioned my first stranger on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 7th grade I started a new school. The same year, a new literature teacher started, Mr. Pope. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was accelerated and took his class with the 8th graders. It was the first time I'd ever struggled in a class. We had to keep a writer's journal, which he graded weekly, and write essays analyzing literature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often struggled to write a page in my journal and a paragraph of the 5-paragraph essay. I had a huge crush on him, though, and hung on his every word. It's embarrassing to admit, but when we read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/span&gt;, I imagined it was my class that crashed on a deserted island, that he, a Vietnam vet, protected me, and that the attraction was mutual. You might say he was my Ralph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose a psychologist would call it transference. He was close to my father's age, and he seemed to care about me in a way that my father never had. He also seemingly had the ability to read my mind, which scared me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never did well enough in his class, but managed to do well enough to become valedictorian of my tiny class, and left him for high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did fine in my English classes for the first couple years, with potato-chip-eating Ms. Newman and motherly Ms. Kilroy, but my inability to write well enough for Mr. Pope nagged at me. In my third year of high school I took creative writing as an elective. We had to keep writers' journals again, and my teacher complimented me on knowing how to keep one. Little did she know. . . I wasn't that great at fiction-writing -- just good enough to get an A. But when we started writing poetry, I hit my stride. I served on the staff of the literary magazine and was published in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I've been through the labyrinth a few times, each time taking on bigger monsters. But I worry that I just tackled the biggest monster of all in my first piece. It's a story that I've held on to for 13 years, and never told anyone in its entirety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now what? The intense drive I felt to get that one out on paper is gone. Everything else seems mundane by comparison. &lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>The more I read other people's posts, the more I begin to understand my own reasons for writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't write for fun as a child as other people did. I've never cared for fiction much, either reading or writing, except for those few books that really sing for me. The Harry Potter series is a good example, but I imagine he's the idol of many a gifted kid with Dursleyish parents. The first book makes me want to cry, when Hagrid shows up and explains to Harry what he really is, and how there's a whole other world where he's normal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's always been about the psychology of it, of working things through and turning the ugly into art. I suppose I took a bit of a wrong turn in my earlier days thinking I wanted to be a writer (a technical writer, even) rather than a shrink, and trying to get published even though I hated the business aspect of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh. . .&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Writing and all that psychology seem to really go hand in hand. Sometimes the writing doesn't have to be for anyone, at least, that's what I'm discovering. As I write more, I sort out my past more, and come to an understanding of myself. It's a very therapeutic process really.</MESSAGE>

&quot;...each time taking on bigger monsters.&quot; Or is that the monster becomes more consistent with who we are, at heart, and thus becomes at once larger and smaller. Perhaps, after all, it becomes what is always has been: a mask.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Being born into a family with the blood of Mark Twain circulating throughout my body, I always had a knack for writing. I guess the creativity started to flow when I was four-years-old and writing comic strips to pass the time at my mom’s workplace while she worked a 9-5 job at a car dealership in Surrey. My drawings were amazing, especially for a four-year old – at least that is what my mom’s friends would tell me. However, the text that I incorporated into the strips was an issue. Rather than writing five word lines, I would fill the entire white space of each box with a large story of dialogue. A year after I started drawing comics, my mom enrolled me in a comic drawing class for beginners. Being the only five year old in the class, it was intimidating for a kid my age. I can remember my instructor telling me to “tighten! Tighten! Tighten!” Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I entered Grade 4 that I realized I needed more space to work with, so I gave up comic drawing as a potential career choice and decided that writing stories would be the way to go. For eight years, I worked on my writing technique, improving my English grades and getting a few pieces published in local newspapers and magazines. After a few published stories emerged, I decided that doing this for free isn’t going to pay the bills, so I applied for the Bachelor of Applied Journalism program at Kwantlen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For almost four years I would hack at articles with my red pen held in one hand and a stress ball clenched in the other. The constructive feedback that my classmates provided me with shaped my writing from absolutely horrendous, to some-what readable, to publishable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember last semester, one of our professors had sent each student a set of 20 stories that we had written in three years prior. Of course the names had been removed to avoid any embarrassment. I have to say, over a short period of three years it is remarkable how far I have come. Whether it is grammar, word usage, tightening or layout, it doesn’t take a long period of time to shape my style of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even back then, a lot of us had crazy ideas that we were talented writers. Oh boy, were we ever wrong. As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect - and even then, there is no such this as truly perfect writing.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

Talent is a funny thing. Other than the fact that it does not exist, in nascent form, it's one of those chimeral forms of the creative life: everyone wants it, no one knows how to find it -- and yet sees it in others.

Talent, in my experience, is a false myth. The truth of the arts involve immersion, and honesty, and the unvarnished reflections of the inner lives of personal and universal myths and dreams.

It's nice to feel talented (as occasionally, all of us should do); but such feelings makes it very difficult to get oneself out of the way. The monstrous, bloated talent of the great writer is a tragic thing, really. All hidden up in there, hiding inside the talent which, in the end, is nothing more than a mask of competence.

The truthful talent is one in which talent falls away in the face of clarity. It's good that you see that.

                <MESSAGE> Via email, Rebecca asked a couple of good questions about craft and narrative. I thought it might be useful to include (part of) my response to her, to wit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it this way: there's you the writer, you the person in the&lt;br /&gt;story, and the reader (three people in total). You want the writer part of you to be invisible, so that the reader and the story you can get to know one another. This is usually accomplished by trying to immerse yourself as the writer in the story, so that you lose that sky-high perspective and actually embody the narrative. It actually has nothing to do with whether you use the word I. This is more about filtering, and the distance or closeness that the writer provides for the reader. Less filter is good (think Hemingway). More filter is bad. You want the reader to be in the story, completely immersed in it, without little voice-overs or author reflections or narrative tricks. That's what immersion is about: the erasure of the filter. It's tough to do. When you master it, you have mastered the form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;| My hands are as old now -- mottled wrinkled, veined --&lt;br /&gt;| as my grandfather's hands were when I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;| I notice that my hands look old now. This surprises me. It reminds me of&lt;br /&gt;| how I used to notice my grandfather's hands. And noticing my own hands&lt;br /&gt;| now makes me feel old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the filter? The first passage is just me: not me filtered through&lt;br /&gt;the writer, but me the person. The second passage is filtered through&lt;br /&gt;the writer, who describes the moment rather than showing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; Susan Orlean seems to&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; gracefully put herself into stories and I'm reading Into Thin Air&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; where Jon Krakauer seems to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; So, how do I put myself into&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; a story and, at the same time, get myself out of the way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's another Zen way of thinking about it: you get out of the way by&lt;br /&gt;remembering that you (the writer) are not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I have always loved to tell stories. When I was a toddler I would talk to anyone who would listen. Some children are shy but not me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I could form letters into words and words into sentences I was writing. Nothing was off limits (for an eight year old that is saying a lot) from sisters stealing candy bars to a Mickey and Minnie wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout elementary school I continued to write but not to the extent I would have liked. You see I have the nasty habit of procrastination. When a writing contest or show would come up I just wouldn't write anything. I kept putting it off until the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I entered high school I was excited to take an accelerated English class that would allow me to finish my English classes a year early. That meant I could take the Creative Writing and Journalism classes without any conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got older I saw my voice developing before my eyes. By gaining life experience I was discovering new angles, words and ideas that I hadn't ever thought of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the time came. I was writing my first in-depth piece for the high school newspaper and I knew I had applied for the right college course. The thrill I got from taking on a hard-hitting, high-profile topic was exhilerating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like Caprice, the last four years have truly helped me push through the end of the labyrinth. Editing classes and CP style classes have tightened my writing. Having multiple stories slashed with red pen and positive feedback have shown me the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work experience only furthered my knowledge. I try to take something from every writer I come into contact because they are all helping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I will never be completely free from the labyrinth because there is always something to learn. Writing is constantly changing and there is no right answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this I feel ready to take on the world. My writing has made me take a closer look at my life and the world around me. I have seen gruesom sights and beautiful sights. And as I prepare to graduate in April, I look forward to where my pen will take me.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I agree...some of the best writing takes place &amp;quot;within the labyrinth&amp;quot;. The labyrinth is an important place, where you learn your voice and what you really want to write about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you had a good time in high school! I'm a little jealous...creative writing classes in high school sounds amazing!&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Writing was never something I strive towards growing up. I never wanted to write a book or have writing as my future career. I've always wanted to be able to use my artistic abilities to create pieces that tell a story. Writing for me is something that just happened. Just recently I found a folder that my Nanny had kept with a story based on a TV show I used to watch called Ghost Writer. I don't remember writing stories for fun when I was younger until I opened this folder so I guess maybe writing was somewhere in the back of my mind. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in grade 11 and 12 I got myself tangled up in a guy that was no good for me. When I ended up moving out with him after I graduated I felt very trapped and used writing as a was to get out the pain without actually hurting myself. During the few months I lived with this guy I wrote little poems to help me talk my way out of this bad relationship. To this day if I miss him at all I either read what I wrote or even think about what I wrote and remember that he is not worth thinking about. I actually used one of these poems in grade 12 English and my teacher was very impressed and told me to continue with it. I tweaked the poem a few times but then lost interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say last semester in IDEAs class with Ross was when I started to really use writing as a therapeutic method. I learned that I could use my writing with my art. A lot of my art is very personal and is based on what I know through experience. Now more than ever I join my words with my images. The piece in the gallery at school right now actually has one of my IDEAs creative projects on it. I have a lot of issues talking about how I feel because it's not always easy getting it out right. But on paper you don't have to worry about how it comes out and in my art I also don't have to worry about how it comes out. It's all about letting others interpret what I mean and make sense of it themselves rather than me smacking them over the head with my issues.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, art is a fusion of everything: dreams, hopes, fears, memories. It's all one great tapestry of interdisciplinary inclusion, and the threads that we pull on creatively are simply those of life's unfoldment. So, in a way, art and life are one.

                <SUBJECT>Working on Deadline</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE>I procrastinate when it comes to doing homework. And so do you. And technology has made it much easier for us to do so. With the possibilities of television and the internet almost endless, I can put off doing my homework until the very last minute because I'll have sidetracked myself watching The Magic Bullet infomercial or playing around on Facebook. And I'm fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost completed a Bachelor's of Applied Journalism degree, and I know that this line of work has contributed to my procrastination. 'Working on deadline' is one of the most frequently used descriptors when discussing a career as a journalist (although with the death of newspapers imminent, deadlines will soon be a thing of the past — at least in print). After four years of having to churn out 300 word, 500 word, 1000 word stories in a couple hours for print, that &amp;quot;skill&amp;quot; has pushed itself over to other aspects of my life: primarily homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't get me wrong, there are assignments that I enjoy doing and I won't procrastinate on those. But there's a reason many of us post our work on Sunday night, close to the midnight deadline. And that's not to say that you're all in journalism and have the same excuse I do, but I feel I can justify my procrastination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's gotten to a point where, even though I know I have lengthy assignments due at midnight on a Sunday, I'll spend the day procrastinating until 7, when I realize that my deadline is approaching. And I give myself enough time to edit and proof my work at least once, so I know that I'm submitting quality work. I feel that journalism has put me in the mindset that deadlines are a good thing. I thrive when it's crunch time. Rather than stumbling over word choice or sentence structure to make the most eloquent piece of writing I can create, I force myself to just write whatever flows out of me. And this gives my writing a much more personal voice, I have found. It speaks from my heart and my mind in my own progressive train of thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm surprised that this has yet to bite me in the ass. I know there are days when my procrastinated work suffers, but most of the time I take pride in the quality of work I can write in such a short span of time. Maybe as time ticks down, my standards lessen just so I can meet the deadline, but at least I feel confident in my writing.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Funny post, Kyle. I agree - deadlines definitely provide that mental caffeine rush as far as creativity goes. However, procrastination did sometimes kick me in the ass when I was a reporter as I could've used the extra time for fact-checking. I learned my lesson then but, hey, here I am posting on Sunday night again!&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, procrastination is a real bugaboo -- in part because it can be so useful and entertaining. I don't tend to work to deadline, so I have the freedom to take my time (sometimes too long) with projects. But I do recognize that the uninterrupted, pristine creative space that I require to do my best work is hard to come by. It's a kind of meditative space, and in this world of ongoing distractions such space is harder and harder to find.

                <MESSAGE> Writing something, anything is easy. Great, amazing, mind-blowing writing is difficult. It's like photography, so many people consider themselves decent photographers because of the tools that take the thinking away. Anybody can open their own Blogger account and string some words together. In both cases, most of the stuff is crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written a lot but I don't know if I've ever written anything great, amazing or mind-blowing. I started working in the journalism business when I was 19 and while I could string a story together it wasn't until four jobs later, when I was 24, when I learned something about writing. I lucked into one of the best newsroom situations that existed - three reporters who, when it came to writing, breathed fire. Even though we worked at the community newspaper level where the inverted pyramid ruled the pages, these people loved writing. It was more than a good lead, or a good angle. It was making the story come alive. These reporters wanted me to write, too, not just report. Wonderful books were left on my desk, magazine articles written by other people were excitedly yanked out of 'Inspirational Writing' folders and once, the paper sent me to the states to attend a conference taught by writers who were famous authors, who worked the crime beat for biggest papers in the country, who used their daily columns to write poetry about current events. It was amazing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the paper, writing was often a challenge. Banging out 12 inches of copy was a cinch but making those words come alive when the clock was ticking and the phone was ringing was sometimes impossible. There were at least seven other stories to write every issue. I wrote and wrote. Once in a while one of the other reporters would leave a sticky note of encouragement on my computer screen. Another time one of them told me that I had to grow into my skill. I suppose, looking back, those words made sense. I was a distracted student, not because my time was divided by also working in the paper's photography department, but also because I was spending my night hours at rock shows and raves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my staffer position eventually to do photography full-time. I did not write a single story for three years and it was beautiful to be able to focus on one craft. But then I wanted to write again. Non-deadline writing is a bit like starting over because it's a new mental process - my brain isn't used to taking its time.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&quot;Writing something, anything is easy...&quot;

Yes, and writing something, anything well is a formidable challenge. I could rewrite all of my previous books at this point in my career and double their quality (well, the first two, anyway; the third one is much better; the most recent one is actually pretty good).

It seems that with writing, the more you know, the less you know. As you improve, you see more things to improve upon. It's quite a process, as you know.

Growing into skill is a good metaphor.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I figured out I wanted to write when I realized I would rather write a ten page short story or 3 poems instead of writing a multiple choice test. Well, maybe that wasn’t the first time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout school I always chose the more creative task. Do a poster board? Or write a research paper? I hate research papers. I never took writing very seriously, and I still don’t. I think it’s important not to force yourself to write, but write when you naturally feel like it. That way, your writing comes out more genuine. I’ve learned that I can’t fake it ‘till I make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My creative process doesn’t start and end in one sitting. I tend to spend too much time just thinking about different topics, characters, situations, and not spending any time actually creating the final chunk of whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly think most of us taking this class, or other classes like it were never into numbers, or theories, or equations. And from the reading my work as well as everyone else’s, it’s interesting to see everyone’s imagination in writing. Especially finishing the Golden Key or The Buddhist Parable stories. I liked reading the different adventures the writers posed for me. &lt;/p&gt;I also learned that word processes are not my friend… </MESSAGE>

Good! That's a very useful bit of knowledge.

And yes, writing takes time, effort, clarity, honesty, insight, and many other skills that come with the territory. All of these things serve what you call genuineness. No fakery indeed.

                <MESSAGE>I like how I am able to try new types of writing. There are new forms to play with, struggle with and best of all, less sense of failure if I don't get it right. There's a little self-delusion that because of the new forms, no wonder I don't expect perfection. In my own work, I'm not expecting perfection anymore. There's a sense of play that was missing. I'm finding my writing is more enjoyable, if only to me, and that's okay. </MESSAGE>

&quot;Play is hard to maintain as you get older. You get less playful. You shouldn't, of course.&quot;  --Richard Feynman, American physicist 1918-1988 
&quot;Just play. Have fun. Enjoy the game.&quot;  --Michael Jordan, American basketball player 
&quot;Children have always learned and created places for themselves through play.&quot;  --Donna R. Barnes, Contemporary American psychologist 
&quot;There is for many a poverty of play.&quot;  --D.W. Winnicott, British pediatrician 1896-1971 
&quot;Play allows us to develop alternatives to violence and despair; it helps us learn perseverance and gain optimism.&quot;  --Stuart Brown, M.D., Contemporary American psychiatrist 
&quot;The very existence of youth is due in part to the necessity for play; the animal does not play because he is young, he has a period of youth because he must play.&quot;  --Karl Groos, German evolutionary biologist 1861-1946 
&quot;If you want to be creative, stay in part a child, with the creativity and invention that characterizes children before they are deformed by adult society.&quot;  --Jean Piaget, Swiss philosopher 1896-1980 
&quot;A child who does not play is not a child, but the man who does not play has lost forever the child who lived in him.&quot;  --Pablo Neruda, Chilean poet 1904-1973 
&quot;I believe that those boys who take part in rough, hard play outside of school will not find any need for horse-play in school.&quot;  --Theodore Roosevelt, American president 1858-1919 
&quot;It is in playing, and only in playing, that the individual child or adult is able to be creative and to use the whole personality, and it is only in being creative that the individual discovers the self.&quot;  --D.W. Winnicott, British pediatrician 1896-1971 
&quot;Now in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of civilized life have their origin: law and order, commerce and profit, craft and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primeval soil of play.&quot;  --Johan Huizing, Dutch historian 1872-1945 
&quot;The playing adult steps sideward into another reality; the playing child advances forward to new stages of mastery.&quot;  --Erik H. Erikson, American psychoanalyst 1902-1994 
&quot;Ritual grew up in sacred play; poetry was born in play and nourished on play; music and dancing were pure play.... We have to conclude, therefore, that civilization is, in its earliest phases, played. It does not come from play...it arises in and as play, and never leaves it.&quot;  --Johan Huizing, Dutch historian 1872-1945 
&quot;We all need empty hours in our lives or we will have no time to create or dream.&quot;  --Robert Coles, Contemporary American child psychologist 
&quot;The child amidst his baubles is learning the action of light, motion, gravity, muscular force.&quot;  --Ralph Waldo Emerson, American writer 1803-1882 
&quot;So, in all these spheres - in painting, sculpture, drawing, music, singing, dancing, gymnastics, games, sports, writing and speech - we can carry on to our heart's content, all through our long lives, complex and specialized forms of exploration and experiment.&quot;  --Desmond Morris, Contemporary British zoologist 
&quot;Play, while it cannot change the external realities of children's lives, can be a vehicle for children to explore and enjoy their differences and similarities and to create, even for a brief time, a more just world where everyone is an equal and valued participant.&quot;  --Patricia G. Ramsey, Contemporary American educational psychologist 
&quot;As astronauts and space travelers children puzzle over the future; as dinosaurs and princesses they unearth the past. As weather reporters and restaurant workers they make sense of reality; as monsters and gremlins they make sense of the unreal.&quot;  --Gretchen Owocki, Contemporary American early childhood educator 
&quot;Pausing to listen to an airplane in the sky, stooping to watch a ladybug on a plant, sitting on a rock to watch the waves crash over the quayside - children have their own agendas and timescales. As they find out more about their world and their place in it; they work hard not to let adults hurry them. We need to hear their voices</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> I have found my monster in my writing with help from Ross and a friend of mine who is currently computer hopping in Australia. Ross told me I needed to be more immediate and get rid of the voice of the speaker, I smiled and nodded but the riddle made little sense to me.&lt;br /&gt; I thought, &amp;quot;How can I make my writing more immediate if I can't seem to find where the problem is&amp;quot;. Last night my friend in Australia read one of my pieces and made some suggestions. That was when I realized my obsession with character possession. IE: &amp;quot;...the door&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;...his door&amp;quot;. It is going to take a long time to read through all of my work to identify my problem but it seems like it will be worth it. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>It wasn't supposed to be a riddle, but useful feedback!

Don't spend too much tome reviewing and revising previous work; that can be a quagmire. Start fresh. And, before you balk at recreating previous work, let me share a small vignette: I wrote 40,000 words of a book (about half) before realizing that I was moving in the wrong direction creatively. I looked back on what I had written, thought about rewriting it, had a few panic attacks, then just filed it all away and started again. The next version was much better, and reflected precisely what I was trying to say. Many famous writers have undergone similar trials: Carlos Fuentes, T.E. Lawrence, etc. Don't revisit; instead, re-create.

The creative imagination enjoys a new landscape more than a facsimile of a previously-trod path.

                <MESSAGE>&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a great writer. I like to write, but I still have a long way to go before I can consider myself to be good at it. That said, I appreciate writing, and I love to read. Perhaps this is why I love English Literature. It allows me to read insane amounts of other peoples writing, and appreciate it. Strangely enough, although I love English Literature, Creative Writing is quite far out of my comfort zone. I think it is because I'm always confused and almost blank about what to write about. But I do love it. I've gained a huge appreciation for it through my friends many of whom are consumed by writing.  The things they write are amazing.  Poems, Stories and Scripts that they are constantly sending me to read over. I consider these people to be the strangers that opened my mind to creative writing and the idea that I could perhaps enjoy composing it as well. They led me into the labyrinth where I am now, and I have to figure it out on my own now, and grow into my own writing. I'm trying to do so by taking classes like this one, hopefully it goes well and helps me face the monster head on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;I believe that I am stuck in the Labyrinth.  Many times when I begin to write I feel very confused and disorientated, not knowing where to start, what to write about, and where to end.  Instead of concentrating so much on the syntax and format of my writing, I believe I need to begin to just let go and let my creativity run wild.  However, for me, this is easier said than done, for I am a very organized and planned person and to let something, such as imagination and creativity take over in my writing is very hard for me.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>Sorry this is late, I've been pretty sick for the past week and I'm severely sleep deprived because of a combination of the flu and my terrible job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the stages of the creative process I'd have to say that I'm still in the labyrinth. But I'm getting pretty tired of sitting the labyrinth, so I've decided to be more proactive at searching for clarity. I can't even remember how long ago the trauma that started it all off happened, but it was about the same time that I decided to get into journalism. It's actually a weird coincidence that the other post was on Hunter S. Thompson, because he was pretty much the sole basis for getting into it in the first place. It been a fairly hectic journey for the past few years, and I've been trying to slow things down lately and settle the grey cloud over my head, but it isn't easy. On top of my courses I'm working two jobs. One is mind numbing but pays the bills, the other is helping my portfolio but my co-workers are alcoholics and crazy (not that I don't love them). It's hard to find time in between it all to sit and read or work on any artistic endeavors. All I want is a little peace, you know? The stress rides me alot too. The article on alcohol, substance abuse, and creative writing really touched home, even though I've been fairly reasonable this semester. I think it pretty much affects every writer I know or at least every journalist I know. Anyways, at least I'm trying to get out of the labyrinth now, before I was just revelling in it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, that's the key: to find the path forward, that path which is always there but which we deride and ignore. Said best by Juan Ramon Jimenez, I think:

I am not I.
I am this one
walking beside me whom I do not see,
whom at times I manage to visit,
and whom at other times I forget;
the one who remains silent while I talk,
the one who forgives, sweet, when I hate,
the one who takes a walk when I am indoors,
the one who will remain standing when I die.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>So I'm guessing we post composition two here? Anyways, most of you have probably read most of what I chose to write about this week...I just tightened and polished some of the original stories that I have been discussing when we talked about the &amp;quot;Labyrinth&amp;quot;...but thanks for taking a look anyways!</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Ask your partner to describe three images. Using the three images, compose a story about how the world began. Share the story with your partner. Discuss the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. rainbow&lt;br /&gt;2. an island&lt;br /&gt;3. an egg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once upon a time, there is an egg in the universe. This egg is not a ordinary white color one. It is in rainbow color and warm. The temperature of the egg is getting warmer and warmer and it seems that it will expose one day. Finally, the egg cracked and it is covered with hot liquid in it. The liquid is like hot lava. It gets cool down and formed a hard surface around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God finds that the egg will be eventually turned into a rock with no lives and love. Then, he decided to put water around the egg and make human to live on it. There is an island on the egg. There are two human on the island, one male and one female. God tells them to have more children so that there will be generations thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how the world began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask your partner to describe one memory. Using the memory as your own, write your own version. Share this version with your partner. Discuss the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The moment waiting for firework in Disneyland, but it got canceled due to strong wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe I am in Disneyland. This is my dream to be there since I was young. I know that there is a firework celebration every night in Disney right in front of the castle. I am so excited and I plan to go there few hours earlier to get the best spot for tonight. It is now ten minute away from the firework show. All the sudden it starts raining. I am so surprised that it will rain today, because the weather forecast say it is a clear night. There will be no firework. The rain take away my dream, my hope and my excitement. When I will get a chance to go back to Disneyland to see the firework? </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>I worked with Rebecca on this. Here are my two exercises, and my thoughts on the collaboration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise #1) The myth words: jackal, unflappable, befuddled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young prince, being eager to take the throne and against his father's socialist methods of ruling, attempted to arrange for his father's murder. The king got wind of his son's plans and confronted him. The prince denied any wrongdoings, but his father, unflappable despite learning his son wants him dead, banished him from his land. The king told his son that he must first learn to take responsibility of his own actions, before he can judge others for their actions.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The prince was escorted by two knights to the furthest edge of the kingdom and was sent, with but the clothes on his back, into the woods on a path towards the far away Kingdom of Protista. As a child, the great king had warned the prince about the sly animals lurking in these woods, and he know felt a great anger towards his father for abandoning him in such a dangerous place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Befuddled by his new surroundings, the prince trekked deep into the forest, unaware that he had stepped onto the wrong path, and was now heading towards the even further away, menacing kingdom of Prokaryota. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After walking absentmindedly through the woods for three days, the prince came upon a jackal, lying in the middle of the path.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Who goes there?&amp;quot; the thin animal called out to the prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I am a prince. I have been banished from the Kingdom of Monera and I am on my way to the Kingdom of Protista to start a new life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sly jackal's ears erected upon hearing of the prince's voyage and approached the young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You have crossed the woods so far from Protista. You are in the direction of Prokaryota, where, as I'm sure you are well aware, the dragons congregate every spring to plan their attacks on these kingdoms.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh dear,&amp;quot; cried the prince. &amp;quot;What an awful mistake. I have walked three days straight and only now realized how far off course I am.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jackal slowly circled at the feet of the prince. He looked up at the teary-eyed young man.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I can direct you to the Kingdom of Protista,&amp;quot; the jackal said. &amp;quot;Follow me, I will take you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair walked day and night until the prince could see the edge of the woods in the distance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you Mr. Jackal for accompanying me to Protista,&amp;quot; he proclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;This is not Protista,&amp;quot; the jackal replied. &amp;quot;I have brought you to Prokaryota, where the dragons are planning their attack on Monera. You will be the ones to stop them. You will fight for your kingdom. You will prosper and will be welcomed back by your people.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exercise #5) The smell of KFC from a block away. The smell of an elevator carrying three old ladies. The taste of dental polish. The taste of hot sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stomach grumbles,&lt;br /&gt;the hygienist warns me to fast for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;My rough tongue skims the enamel of a faux-blanched incisor,&lt;br /&gt;when a sting of sweet dental polish excites my gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt; My stomach grumbles.&lt;br /&gt;The elevator descends back to an unhygienic world.&lt;br /&gt;Chanel No. 5 sticks to my clothes from being boxing in by three old women.&lt;br /&gt;A smell reminiscent of summers with my grandmother,&lt;br /&gt;a purebred Mexican with a culinary flair.&lt;br /&gt; An aromatic mix of perfume and hot peppers.&lt;br /&gt;Only the burn hot sauce can remove the acrid taste of Chanel from salsa.&lt;br /&gt;Like grandma used to make.&lt;br /&gt;My stomach grumbles.&lt;br /&gt;The elevator women discuss their bunions.&lt;br /&gt; I suffocate in their scent, their conversation.&lt;br /&gt;Freedom at last,&lt;br /&gt;The doors open at ground floor.&lt;br /&gt;A cold wind burns my face.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of fried chicken from down the block titillates my nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;My stomach grumbles.&lt;br /&gt; Damn dental rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess as far as the 'collaboration process' goes, it seemed fairly simple and straightforward to me. I thank technology for that, as well as the fact that we got in contact before the Sunday deadline. And despite the fact that we didn't necessarily need huge interactions to give each other a couple of words, or actions, or senses, I'll argue that both of our backgrounds in journalism helped us with this. The collaboration process (with an editor or fellow journalists in particular) are a large part of our work. We bounce story ideas, thoughts, sources, etc. off one another as journalists, and it translates well in collaboration exercises like this. It may or may not help the writing, but it definitely assists in the actual process because we're used to it. I know that I considered what I know about Rebecca and her writing (which isn't very much) so that my suggestions were so obscure that it would be an impossible challenge for her, but would be in line with her writing style. And I tried to give suggestions that would make for a bit more of a fun exercise to do. I was TOTALLY against writing a poem beforehand, as you know, but I loved her suggestions for #5 so much that I decided to do it. So it seems she did something similar. Unless she had KFC and went to the dentist yesterday, then I feel that she put some consideration into the creativity aspect of giving examples so that it would be more of a fun exercise, than a chore. And it turned out to be fun. My writing results aren't great, but the randomness of her suggestions definitely made it so that it was more of an enjoying assignment to write. And again, that goes back to even trying to figure out story ideas in journalism: bouncing ideas back and forth, and ultimately coming to a really good idea thanks to collaboration. Obviously this wasn't as in depth of a converation as journalism ideas sometimes require, but it's essentially the same thing, and something we're used to.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;#5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binge drinking, sticky kitchens, and library lives.&lt;br /&gt;Being a student is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight off the plane with too many&lt;br /&gt;Bags, determined judgments, and financial worries&lt;br /&gt;Coming to a town with a gray smell&lt;br /&gt;Where snow boots are essential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally&lt;br /&gt;A place to experience freedom&lt;br /&gt;A place to have less than a fiv’er in your pocket&lt;br /&gt;Yet find a way to buy Old Milwaukee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used textbooks and laptops litter the living room&lt;br /&gt;As empty Absolut bottles stand guard atop the fridge&lt;br /&gt;Like boozy soldiers&lt;br /&gt;Beside the Cheerios and Fruit Loops&lt;br /&gt;The ones that score your pallet&lt;br /&gt;After a once forgotten night at Ale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That started with a round table and a&lt;br /&gt;Pack of cards missing the Jack of spades&lt;br /&gt;Waking up the next morning &lt;br /&gt;With a fuzzy mouth, while stepping&lt;br /&gt;Into the living room filled with&lt;br /&gt;Forgotten moments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beer-stained air and stale alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Leaking off the furniture&lt;br /&gt;Never ends but defines the art&lt;br /&gt;Of being a student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world began with only silence. The rivers flowed with fury and desire, but came and went without a sound. Shards of rocks jutted out from the whitecaps, and attacked oncoming debris. Only one river ran through here. After decades of silence, a woven treasure appeared on the river, stuck in the brush beside the icy chill of the rushing water. Within the woven basket appeared a newborn baby, abandoned and alone. The infant screamed for days and nothing heard the silence. Upon losing its voice, it too became silent. This moment created the beginning of earth itself. Flashing lights emitted from the sky repeatedly. One after the other, they filled the sky with light. Upon moments and moments of blinding flashes, a harmonious peace filled the space, which was now, Earth. &lt;/p&gt;The first poem I wrote was based on 4 sounds and tastes that my friend gave me. They were: the smell from getting off the plane, the smell of a living room full of leftover beer, the taste in your mouth when you wake up, and Fruit loops. It was pretty easy to configure a poem off of those senses, but I thought creating a sequence and plot to follow would be quite difficult. And it was. But I enjoyed writing it more than the story. The story was made up of three images: a newborn baby, a whitewater river, and a strobe light. Very difficult. I know. I found myself conscience of being logical rather than creative. Overall, I enjoyed the assignment though. It made me think outside the box. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;#1 - three words: conspicuous, genealogy, music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen hundred years ago there lived a very conspicuous man.  He would wander around town reciting a genealogy of some sort.  No one knew of which family he was referring to.  Day after day he would wander the streets reciting the same names in the same order.  Sometimes he would whisper it to himself, sometimes he would sing it out loud, as if it were music, and sometimes he would say it in a booming voice as if he were preaching to a crowd.  Everyone knew about this conspicuous man, but nobody dared approach him.  One day a new family moved into this town.  The boy, being approximately twelve, was very outgoing and not intimidated or creeped out by the old man in the least bit.  After watching him for a couple days, he approached the man asking him why he was reciting a genealogy.  The man stopped, shocked by the fact that another human being was talking to him and then got down on his knees, looked the boy in the eye and said the answer to all lifes problems are in the names that I say everyday.  The boy did not understand, but before he could ask any questions, the old man disappeared.  It is said that to this day, people in small towns, will still see the old man walking around reciting the same genealogy.  What it means and if there is any truth to what the old man told the little boy, no one will every know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a little girl, at the age of five, I was a deviant and mischevious.  In my mind, the word &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; meant how much farther can I push my mom.  Well on this particular day I decided to push her to her limit.  Many times my mom had told me to stay away from the gas fireplace, as it was hot and dangerous.  In my mind, she was just trying to keep me from having fun.  So one day, when she was in the shower I decided to see how hot and dangerous this fire really was.  I edged my way closer and closer to the fire and nothing bad seemed to be happening.  With a piece of paper in my hand, I decided I was going to create my own fire in the backyard.  Carefully, I dipped the paper into the gas fireplace and once it had lit I began to walk towards the back sliding glass door.  But before I could get there, the fire started to burn closer and closer to my hand.  Scared, I let go of the paper and it dropped onto the creme coloured carpet.  Since it was only a small fire, it burnt out with a few stomps from my runners, but it left a large black soot mark that I couln't hide from my mom.  It wasn't long before she discovered it and I was sent to my room for a long time.  Never again did I go near that fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it a lot easier to create the memory as my own then to write a story with those three words.  I had to use my creativity and imagination to write the myth, where I wasn't as strained to re-write the memory.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;span lang=&quot;EN&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collaborated with Caprice =D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Three sounds: Sirens. Laughter. Gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the shooting that happened near the Watershed isn’t too far from Caprice’s house and so she thought of those sounds. I loved the idea of these sounds because two work together but the other is a stark contrast. I can link the two but also compare and create a powerful image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laughter is Gone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t sleep through the night without you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were taken too soon by someone you didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to do the things you use to do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am wandering aimlessly, with nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chorus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sirens screaming down the street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what they’re going to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting in my room with the light on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand the dark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the laughter is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss you more than words can say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is the last thing I do I will make them pay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strangers took you away from me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only they could see…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chorus: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sirens screaming down the street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what they’re going to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting in my room with the light on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand the dark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the laughter is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best days are no more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t even walk by myself to the store&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the card you had drawn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the laughter is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Three images: A flower blooming. A dog urinating. A flag flapping in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so these three images totally threw me at first. I thought, how on earth did she come up with those. But as I thought about my view of the world I started to form an idea. It may be a crazy idea but there wasn’t anything in this assignment that said it couldn’t be crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of years ago there was no earth. The solar system existed but there was a large gap between Venus and Mars’ moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the far edge of the system sat Pluto, home to Smidgen the guard dog. He watched over the system, protecting it from the thousands of species looking to invade. He was a happy dog that loved doing what he was doing. He chased ships, swatted at asteroids and chased comets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one day one of the comets he was chasing led him farther than he’d ever gone. It led him to Mars and its moon. The comet was gone but it left something behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dog approached the floating white oval and sniffed it out. Confused as to what this was he did what came naturally. He walked forward a couple of steps, lifted his leg and urinated on the white oval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as he was done the comet returned. Smidgen was off like a flash, chasing the comet back to his planet. Little did he know he had just set off a train reaction of epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next hundred years the white oval, which was a seed, began to bloom like a flower. But this was no ordinary flower. It was a gorgeous blue and green swirl flower with spots of white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seed created a brand new planet. One that could be inhabited by man. One where plants thrive, animals roam and children run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: I liked the idea of the dog’s urine creating the world because as amazing as the world is…we all know how “pissy” it can be at times ahahahaha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Two tastes and two smells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell: Cinnamon buns and vanilla&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tastes: Sugar and Bacon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the easiest for me. I don't know why. Maybe because I love these things just as much as Caprice does. I really want all of these food now, thanks man ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun sparkles against my window, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my body relents as I stretch away the sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath, sucking in, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every last moment of this bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell of cinnamon buns,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and vanilla mingle with the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It creates an intoxicating aroma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it calls me to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I push back my blankets,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and follow the smell downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet drag on the floor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the remnants of a good nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the table I &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reach for the bacon and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;savour the amazing taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a spoon full of cereal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sprinkled with sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taste dances in my mouth,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t trade this for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;A Myth, using the words &amp;quot;Lamp, Ribbon, Mirror&amp;quot;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;There once was a girl who had never seen a mirror. Upon birth, her parents had tied a ribbon over her eyes and removed all of the mirrors from her bedchamber. &lt;br /&gt;The girl never bothered to remove the ribbon from her eyes, for she soon learned to live without her sight. She played happily on the floor of her nursery with her toys, and knew her parents by the sounds of their voices and the way that their faces felt. She never left her wing in her parent's home - all of her food was delivered to  her by her nurse, and she was tutored by a kind old man who taught her to read Braille. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time that the girl felt deprived of sight was at night, when a penetrating blackness seemed to pierce through the thin fabric of her ribbon  when she turned her lamp out. The girl would stumble from her bed to the balcony in the corridor, and would stand under the light of the moon, feeling soothed by the breeze and the pale light from the stars.&lt;br /&gt;One night, a farm boy who worked on her parents garden saw her. He had been restless, and was walking along the  edge of the property, deprived of sleep. He never said a word, he just stared at the girl, his heart breaking for her lack of sight.  The boy came back the next night to watch the girl on the balcony, and the next, and the next. Finally, one night, without a word, he shimmied up a vine on the wall of the house, and leaped lightly onto the balcony next to the girl. Although she was terrified, she did not move. The boy quickly removed a small blade from his trouser pocket, and expertly cut the ribbon  from her eyes. Before she could see him, he jumped from the edge of the balcony, holding a scrap of ribbon in his&lt;br /&gt;hands.&lt;br /&gt;The girl marvelled at the world, wondering how she could have missed out on such beauty. After pondering the night sky, and the sunrise, she finally turned to go back inside. The girl then saw her own reflection, mirrored in the shiny surface of a glass pane on the balcony door. She saw at once that she was beautiful - so stunning, in fact, that her parents had wanted to hide her - from the world, and from herself.&lt;br /&gt;The girl went into her room, packed a few clothes into her bag, and ran out the front door of her parent's home before they were even awake. She began to search for the farm boy, knowing that he would have the missing scrap of ribbon. She wanted to thank him.&lt;br /&gt;The girl searched for many years -- she travelled to many different continents and countries, discovering the beauty of the world around her. Everyone who met her was astounded at her beauty, and she received many offers of marriage wherever she went. But the girl knew that her heart truly belonged to the one who had freed her.&lt;br /&gt;One day, she found him, begging on the side of the road. He was poor and starving, for his parent's had disowned him after discovering what he had done to the daughter of their employers. He was destitute, but he still had the scrap of ribbon, worn on a string about his neck. He had loved the blind girl from the moment he had laid his eyes on her.&lt;br /&gt;The girl bent to her knees, opening her palm to reveal the missing scrap of ribbon. The boy had grown ugly and hardened from his time of poverty, but when he saw her, his face lit up in a grin. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;A Memory&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;We leave the thick, humid air of Barranquilla, Columbia, in the early morning hours. Already, the tang of sweat and dirt seeps in through the crack at the bottom of my bedroom door -- a thick, yellow wave that clogs the lungs and stifles the pores.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;I ride up the mountainside with my parents, going to the Missionary school in Carmello. As we ride, passing the scrubby green of the hillside, the humidity lifts, and a cool breeze blows like kisses against my skin.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;The school at Carmello has a slide, a long aluminum snake stretching 300 feet down the hill. There is a kitchen, and a black pock of a firepit. When I wake up the next morning, I see a vine snaking around the window of my room. The mountain air is startling cold and clear, like a fresh drink of water.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Even now, in Canada, I sleep with my bedroom window open, and in the cool spring mornings, the air reminds me of the mountain air that I tasted thirty years ago. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>ok I've done one of the collaboration but have been struggling with the other one. I don't know how to put what my friend gave me into a song so I'm going to try someone else I think and see if I can get a spark out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this exercise is that I take a lot of the things I do from a personal stand point and I have a hard time taking something from someone else and get something out of it. The poem one exercise 5 was not too bad I just made the best story I could out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5&lt;br /&gt;This is what my friend gave me:&lt;br /&gt;stank smells like butt&lt;br /&gt;sea air smells salty and fresh and slightly like dead fish&lt;br /&gt;tastes like delicious yeast barley and hopps&lt;br /&gt;salty, spicy, and tangy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Poem&lt;br /&gt;Sitting on tall stools&lt;br /&gt;Back aching my butt numbing&lt;br /&gt;Memories drift through my hazed head&lt;br /&gt;As the delicious yeast, barley, and hopps trickle down my throat.&lt;br /&gt;Remembering the last time&lt;br /&gt;When I was in this frame of mind&lt;br /&gt;The sea air smelled salty-fresh&lt;br /&gt;Slightly like dead fish.&lt;br /&gt;Slinging the bottle&lt;br /&gt;Back and forth&lt;br /&gt;Water washes back and forth over my bare feet.&lt;br /&gt;Tears fall as the booze numbs the pain&lt;br /&gt;Pain of loss&lt;br /&gt;A hot pain that I can taste.&lt;br /&gt;Salty, spicy, tangy&lt;br /&gt;It burns my throat.&lt;br /&gt;The yeast, barley, and hopps freezes me.&lt;br /&gt;I slide slowly to the sand&lt;br /&gt;Lids close lazily. &lt;br /&gt;The pain subsides&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hey sorry about the lateness. So I tried a couple people and it's funny how immature people are over the age of twenty when there asked for words, sounds, smells, and tastes. So I asked my 14 year old sister for three words and her words were zebra, cheese and purple which was awesome and sparked an idea instantly. I think sparks need to happen in writing and I was just not getting it from my room mate when I asked her. My sister is a creative kid and took this more seriously and was totally cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tale of a zebra. Not just any zebra but a very special zebra &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that was discovered by a lonely old shoemaker. One day while the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shoemaker was taking his daily walk through the forest behind his &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cottage he tripped and fell over a rotted tree root and hit his head &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quite hard. The poor old man went unconscious and surely would have been &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a tasty dinner for the wolves that come out at night until a zebra came &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trotting along. The zebra gave the little old man a nudge and licked the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brow of his head. With a mumble the man awoken startled and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disoriented. He sat up quickly and stared at the zebra. This zebra was &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;magnificent with a long curly mane that fell down to the mid of her &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;body. She was smaller than what the man would imagine a zebra to be but &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he had never been this close to one before and really only decided she &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was a zebra because of her stripes. However, her stripes were not like &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the stripes he had seen and been told zebras had. These stripes were the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most intense and rich color purple he had ever seen and against the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;white of the rest of the zebras body he was in awe of her beauty. The &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;old man got up realizing how dark it was getting and decided he had &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better get home. He gave the zebra a pat and pulled out a chunk of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheese he had tucked in his pocket for his walk and gave it to her. The &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zebra shook furiously and squealed so loud the shoemaker had to cover &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;his ears. The zebra fell to the forest floor shook once more and went &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;limp. The shoemaker was terrified he killed the zebra who more than &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;likely saved his life and went to comfort the zebra. In that instant a &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;marvelous glow came from the heart of the zebra and all of a sudden she &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;transformed right in front of the shoemakers eyes. The zebra was no &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;longer a zebra but a marvelous woman with hair the color purple of the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zebras stripes. The woman thanked the man for his generosity because she &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was starving and said she had been waiting for a hundred years for the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;generosity of a human but could never get it because most were to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shocked by her uniqueness to approach her. She told her story about a &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;god named Zugar that changed her into the zebra because of his jealousy &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over her. The zebra woman's name was Naleev and she was a goddess of a &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;land now lost and in her despair hoped for a second chance to rebuild &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;her kingdom. The man was in shock as Naleev pronounced the shoemaker her &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;right hand and god to her new kingdom, restoring his youth and giving &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;him eternal life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Okay guys. Here it is. I'm not completely satisfied with it, but I never really am with pieces like this. I always think of something after the fact. But anyways, this was really rushed and I hope its okay. As Kyle said in his labyrinth piece, working on a deadline can sometimes produces great work.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;A Life Changing Journey&lt;br /&gt;=======================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up feeling a rush of emotions and I cannot decipher one from another.  I feel happy, excited, paranoid, nervous, anxious, terrified and thankful all at once.  Happy because I am taking a two week vacation.  Excited because I am experiencing something this is once in a life time.  Paranoid because I have to drive in a fifteen passenger van with fourteen people.  Nervous because I’m going to do a strange place and I have a lot of responsibility put on my shoulders.  Anxious because I don’t know what I’m getting myself into.  Terrified because were sleeping in tents and I hear there’s scorpions everywhere, and thankful because I’m going to a place to help others who have a lot less than me.  These are only a few of the feelings I feel as I wake up about to embark on my journey to Mexico.  As you might’ve already guessed, this is not a jump on a plane and stay at a five-star resort kind of a vacation.  This is jump in a van with fourteen other people, who after five days of driving will smell like they haven’t showered in months and then stay in a tent on a dirt ground with bugs everywhere.  Amidst all my feelings, I think the excitement was taking first place and even though it is five o’clock in the morning I am wide awake.  Actually, I haven’t slept all night because I am so enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gather at the school, pack our bags into the trailer, which is situated behind the fifteen passenger van, and say our last goodbyes.  Two weeks isn’t that long of a time, but nonetheless, parents wanted their hugs and kisses all the same.  My mom hugs for what seems like eternity.  Doesn’t she know that I’m sixteen and way too old to be showing that much affection to my mother.  It was one of those hugs like she was never going to see me again.  As I back away, I see a tear stream down her face.  Embarrassed I quickly tell her that I will be home soon and not to miss me too much.  We all pile into the van and are excited as ever to begin our adventure, not knowing of the rollercoaster that awaits us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road trip begins as a blast.  All of us on minimal sleep but jittery from the Starbucks run on the way out of town.   Since some people don’t know everyone so well, we start off with small talk, but it only takes a couple of hours before were old friends and the bus if full of roaring laughter and tears from everyone crying from such intense giggles.  Its amazing how “eye spy with my little eye” can be such an entertaining game amongst a van of sixteen year olds.  We stop for a couple pee breaks before lunch.  What can I say, I have a small bladder!  As lunch approaches, we all pile out of the car eager to fill our grumbling bellies with some artery clogging McDonald’s fast food.    We get back in the car, but not with a little less excitement.  Its been eight hours of driving and eye spy is no longer amusing and neither is Sylvia’s feet which seem to have made their way on either side of my nose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time dark approaches and we have made our way to our motel for the night, we are all ready for sleep in a nice bed.  As we only paid $1000 for our trip, The Fairmont isn’t exactly in our budget and so Motel 6, which later became known amongst our group as Motel Marvelous.  The change of name was our attempt to give the motel a little class, which it lacked in about every other aspect.  After dinner and quick dip in the pool, we all made our way our separate rooms and were out without a chance to brush our teeth or wash our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five o’clock came quite early the next morning, and with a lot less excitement than the first day and a lot more frustration we all piled into the van.  We knew the day we had ahead of us and nobody was looking forward to another fourteen hour day in the van.  Every noise, every gurgle, and every foot began to irritate me.  I was beginning to get worried as it was only day two of the fourteen day adventure and I already couldn’t stand about half the people I was with.  As the evening approached, tension was running high in the van, as I think most people’s feelings were similar to mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was good news, as that night we would be arriving in Mexico.  Our first obstacle was the border.  Mexican borders are quite different from those that I’ve crossed passing from Canada into the US.  At a Mexican border, you get in a line, and then once you get to the crossing there is a green or a red light that flashes.  If you get a green light, you are able to pass through with no interrogation.  However, if you get a red light, you are stopped, pulled over, and asked a million questions.  With fourteen people in the van, there fourteen passports, and of those fourteen passports, four were not Canadian.  You do the math.  We were praying for a green light.  As every car in front of us passed through the border crossing, each one of us got more and more nervous.  When it was our turn, the light turned….green.  We were so thrilled, so excited we couldn’t contain ourselves and the whole van burst into a round of applause.  Who were we clapping for?  Nobody, we were happy that the light turned green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next obstacle was driving in Mexico.  Driving in Mexico is not walk in the park.  The roads are narrow, scary, and very few people follow the traffic laws.  I can remember the instant scenery change as we crossed that border.  Our eyes open wide as we are exposed to a whole other world.  Yes, before going we saw videos of what it would be like to be in Mexico and pictures of their living situations, but nothing in the world could compare us for what we were to see.  The houses turn from what we consider normal civilization to houses that don’t even deserve to be called shacks.  Children running around everywhere, dogs without leashes and houses with no windows paint a vivid picture in my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more hours pass by, and I don’t believe a single one of our mouths closed or eyes shut for that entire time.  We arrive to the campsite, still in culture shock, but mainly exhausted.  Where we are staying is a big open dirt field with a long hill leading up to our meeting place and cafeteria.  In order to unload the trailer, we stand in a military line and pass the luggage down from one person to another and make a pile on one of the large orange tarps.  Most of the baggage are large duffle bags, an odd small suit case, and then comes mine.  The biggest suitcase I own.  I know that we weren’t going to Mexico to impress anyone with our clothes, but I’m an over packer, and there’s nothing I can do about that.  I needed at least a change of clothes every day and then some on top of that.  I along with the other three girls set up our tent, with a little help from the guys and place our duffle bags and my suitcase inside; because there is no way that I’m leaving my clothes outside for the dirt and bugs to get to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other groups started to pull in and set up their tents, the reality of this whole experience begins to set in.  I begin my climb up the steep hill, stumbling over rocks and sticks, thinking to myself of what lies ahead of me.  People say that missions trips transform your life, and change your way of thinking.  I went into this trip thinking I would gain all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had gathered at the top of the hill, we were assigned the church that we are to stay at and what our duties are going to be.  My group went into this trip expecting to help underprivileged kids and for this reason what we hear next is a shock.  We are told by the leader of the camp that we are going to a church and we are going to help them build an add-on and do some minor renovations.  I don’t know what I’m going to do.  I don’t paint, I don’t build, and I definitely don’t do any form of physical labor, especially when I’m doing it for free.  Later one we all head back down to our tents and we are all feeling confused, frustrated, and shocked.  Our team leader, Mrs. Memmott emphasizes with our emotions but tells us that we are hear to give of ourselves, and if that means using a hammer and banging in some nails, then that is what we will do.  In loving words, she explains to us that we need to suck it up, get over our fears of the unknown and be willing to work hard.  So I take one more minute to be sorry for myself and I moved on to thinking positively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed along the bumpy road to the church.  This church does not look like any other church I’ve seen.  It consists of four walls and a sorry excuse for a tin roof.  I could instantly see that this church needs our help and almost instantaneously the selfish feelings that I was feeling the night before vanish.  Right away we set to work, the girls painting and the boys taking on some of the heavier work.  I have never done such hard work in my life and I haven’t since.  Strangely I left the church that day, not feeling exhausted and over-worked, but exhilarated and accomplished.  The days go on and we continue working hard, every day feeling that same sense of accomplishment.  There were no doubt some bumps on the way, such as my friend falling off the ladder and breaking her foot and the van ride there and back, full of emotions, but overall it was life changing experience, just as people had told me.  It was by far the best vacation I have ever taken.  There is something indescribable about putting others before yourself and in my opinion there is no greater joy that comes from that type of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Full of Fullers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;By Christopher Poon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I knew it would have been too good to be true, there was still a part of me that wished it would more like Willy Wonka and his amazing chocolate factory. Nevertheless, as I stood at the gates of the Fuller’s brewery a tear ran down my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or a raindrop, it was hard to tell, what with it raining and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had about an hour to kill before the tour was to begin, but luckily there was a pub built into the side of the brewery, so we ducked in for a pint and some food. Upon entering, I looked around the place and noticed that I was the youngest person in there by at least ten years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pub seemed to attract workers from the brewery itself, as well as businessmen and other workers from the surrounding shops and offices. Being a part of the Fuller’s brewery, the pub had nearly all of the company’s drinks on tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most would be hard-pressed to find a place that had two or three of the same company’s drinks together, and so this was indeed a rare treat. We ordered our food and drinks, and sat down at a small table by a window. We happened to finish our meal at the time that the tour was to begin and so we downed our drinks and made for the exit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small group had gathered by the doorway of the pub, and short, squat woman with a clipboard asked for our names. She checked something off on her sheet and said that we were still waiting on four more people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting ten more minutes, she told the bartender to keep an eye out for four ‘tourists’ and then off we went to the brewery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was it, birthplace of one &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;London Pride&lt;/span&gt;, the ale that I had claimed as my favourite, while still an underage drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back into the rain, we were led around the side of the brewery, through a small-gated archway and into a large industrial-looking building.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of Oompa Loompas, surly-looking middle-aged men drove forklifts carrying palettes of kegs, worked the controls of a bottle sorter and rolled casks from one place to another. Any chance of a song was extinguished by loud machinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we walked along the criss-crossing catwalks throughout the factory, the guide recited the history of Fullers, Turner and Smith (the official name of the company) and how this particular brewery was the last remaining in London. We were told about the function of large copper kettles, felt the flowery texture of the hops and saw how the ales and lagers were brewed and aged.&lt;br /&gt;There were no shimmering waterfalls composed of ales, merely the industrial method by which my favourite ale was produced. Finally, we were promised a special treat for the tour’s conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were led out of the industrial building and across a courtyard to a staircase leading to a small door below ground level. It opened to a long, low-ceiling basement that had the feel of a bomb shelter. The room was made from old-looking bricks, all of which were painted the same dull white and the walls were adorned with vintage posters and various knick-knacks from the company’s history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was slightly musty smell in the air, but after having given up on all hopes of Ooompa Loompas and rivers of ale I didn’t mind. The guide began to show us the posters and memorabilia, but suddenly the group’s attention was drawn to the back corner of the basement. There a small bar was set-up, with shelves stacked with various Fuller beers. There was even several taps, also boasting Fuller’s beers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tour guide must have realized that she’d lost her audience and informed us that our ‘surprise’ was a tasting at the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure how, but there are times where people are able to appear as if they’re walking, when they are in fact moving as quickly, if not faster, than those who would run. This is exactly the kind of action that found the group suddenly at the bar, and the tour guide handing out glasses to each of us. There were five different beers on tap, and we were given permission to pull our own drinks from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly the magic and wonder came flooding back, and as I eagerly filled my glass, somebody from the group asked how much we were allowed to drink.&lt;br /&gt;The tour guide looked at the person, then over to me as my glass neared full.&lt;br /&gt;“Drink as much as you’d like.”&lt;br /&gt;And with that, five waterfalls of beer began to fall.&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;As a member of a religious community, my beliefs would definitely have an impact on my writing. I do believe that religion changes over time, as people's basic needs and societal values change over time. Religion is an extremely malleable thing -- it can meet people's needs and provide them with answers in many different types of situations. As a writer, I would adapt some of my religious stories, as long as the core values and beliefs remained the same. Doing this would provide opportunities for fresh discussion on the topic, and would help open people's imagination and hearts up a little more to some of the religious ideas that I feel are important. Strict adherents probably wouldn't like the work, but as long as I felt that the book remained true to the core values of my beliefs, I would not worry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;There would be no doubt in my mind that the writer in question has stolen my intellectual property. Logically then, if he is a thief, I would have to go about accusing him in a deliberate, legally correct way. I would initially try to contact him about his use of my work, and if he did not respond, then I would most likely sue him, and try to generate some public awareness about  the true source of his work. Perhaps he has added a compelling story to my initial research, but since he gives no credit to my initial research, people should not publicly regard him as a great &amp;quot;scholar&amp;quot; and innovator. At very least, I would try to contact as many media outlets as I can once I started the process of suing him, just to generate public awareness. &lt;!--l. 664--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 5 &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;!--l. 665--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;As a member of this community, I would recognize that no one will probably ever transcribe the stories of my community to make everyone completely satisfied. In my opinion, if the writer has done a good job, then I would support him and his work. As long as the writer has stayed true to the main beliefs and customs of my community, I would be happy with what he has done. The stories will now be preserved for future generations, and I would tell other members of my community that. Some of the life and vividness has gone out of the stories, since they can now only be told one way (the writer's way), but the main thread of narrative is still preserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;If I was the writer, I would argue similar things. The stories have been preserved, and I have done as much as I possibly could to record them in a correct way. If the community members still do not welcome me, I would be sad, but would respect their decision and would leave them alone. &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You are a board member of an organization that supports rights and freedoms worldwide. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;I have a few issues with this dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;1. The author must have known that he was breaking the law -- as soon as he began his research, he must have learned of the publication ban -- and yet he went ahead and did it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;2. His publisher was complicit in breaking the law. Why have they not been charged and why are they not paying to defend him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;3. The writer presumably made money from taking this chance. Why is he not paying his own legal fees? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;4. Breaking the law in this instance does not seem to serve a higher purpose -- freedom, justice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;5. There are, I am sure, writers seeking grants in other countries where the trials are not as fair, where torture and the death penalty are still conducted, and where there are higher values involved. In their civil disobedience, these writers are willing to risk more severe consequences. Why should the committee choose him over them? Canada is a pretty cushy place to be charged of a crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;In short, no, he shouldn't receive the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2 &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You take on an editing project for a writer who could generously be called eccentric. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;The vengeful part of me wants to steal one of his other ideas and write and publish it under my own name, but that is the vengeful part of me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;I am wondering what the contract said, if there was one. While the eccentric writer is under an ethical obligation to credit his collaborator, he may not be under a legal one. May have to chalk this one up to a huge lesson learned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;But if the contract is not written that way, or there is no contract, I would have to believe there is documentation of the collaboration -- letters, e-mails, marked-up manuscripts, payments, phone calls, etc. There should also be an unmistakable similarity in style to my other work. And the eccentric writer has threatened legal action. At this point, I should hire an attorney (and countersue if he bluffs). Maybe I should apply for a grant from the committee in dilemma 1. . . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 3 &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You are working on a contemporary novel of interconnected stories based on your cultural and religious background. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;1. The work is fictional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;2. The intent is not to offend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;3. Presumably no one is being targetted or confidentiality breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;I'd be tempted to publish it under a pseudonym. I know which book this refers to, and I know how vehement the extremists of that particular religion can be. I shouldn't have to risk my life over a work of fiction, but then, I grew up in a different part of the world, in which free expression does not usually carry such serious penalties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do? And why?&lt;/strong&gt; I would not give this author the money. The simple fact is he broke the law by publishing facts of the case. Publication bans are not a secret and the public is usually fully aware of them thus the author most likely would have been too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that he broke the law, he shouldn’t be helped by the committee when there are far more pressing needs. Some countries don’t let people publish opinion articles because the government doesn’t agree with them. Their punishments are far far worse than Canada and I feel their circumstances warrant the grants more than someone who knowingly broke the law.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do you do? And why? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4 &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What do you do? And why? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This is similar to the above situation. I would pursue legal action. I would obviously have my records of research. It would be interesting to see if the new author has similar records. If I conducted interviews, I would seek their support and ask them to testify that it was me and only me they talked to.&lt;/b&gt;I would pursue legal action. As a journalist I am trained to hate plagiarism and know when to spot it. Because the “author in name” can’t write to save his life and I have proof of that in the letter. And more than likely I have a dated draft of the original book and the records would be on his computer. To me there is enough evidence to prove that I am the true author and he has stolen my work.&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a board member, I would vouch for his assistance for legal funding. I think that the writing industry is about change and pushing limits. What exactly should/can be written about. I would probably have to know a little more about the “disturbing details” but I mean if you feel uncomfortable reading it, don’t. I think that writing is an art form, and I find it unethical to hinder people’s expression. Being a proud Canadian, I would also allow the grant because he is a fellow Canadian looking for support and since this organization “supports rights and freedoms worldwide” I think we should support his freedom of speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in this situation, it is important not to stoop to this bad writer’s level. Yes, your book was critically acclaimed, yes, you should have gotten praise for it, and yes it is completely unfair. But books are being written every second of the day and instead of getting messy and having this man potentially ruin you with the hard earned money he stole, write another book. Write a better book. Fuel all that anger and frustration into a force and write something else. It’s better to move on and create something new rather on dwell on something bad that happened. So what if it doesn’t get as good a review as the one he took credit for? Critics don’t even know what they’re talking about half the time…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before writing, I would take a few months off and take some time to breathe. Or else your writing might be full of angst. I know mine would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be a very tough situation to go about. The author writes a book seemingly identical to your own, but puts it in a novel form. I would try and contact this author and pose as a journalist or something and ask him how and where he formulated his ideas from. And bring up your book and the striking similarities between the two. If he talks about the honesty of his writing and research and says that he did it all himself, just nod your head and agree with him. Then, SOMEHOW, get a writer from your local paper to do a piece comparing the two pieces of writing and point out the similarities. This will then be published in the next issue, proving to the world that you were the mastermind behind the whole thing. And that should satisfy your revenge. Muahahaha…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Okay, I got a little creative for the last one… it might not be completely ethical, but I tried)&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETHICAL DILEMMA # 2: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I would definitely feel very hurt and upset that this man has not credited me in any way, especially since most of the writing was done by me. First, I would contact him and let him know that what he has done is wrong. If he fails to apologize and actually do something about it, ie. come forward to the media and also decline the literary prize, then it would leave me no choice but to take him to court and prove that I deserve some credit towards the book. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETHICAL DILEMMA # 4: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;Again, I would definitely have to bring this situation to a court of law where I can undoubtedly prove that this person has used my research without crediting the source. I think that by doing this, it will set an example for other writers to realize the importance of crediting one’s sources in their own writing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;ETHICAL DILEMMA # 1: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;Considering that I am a board member that supports rights and freedoms of writers, I would thoroughly look into all the facts presented. Based on the facts, I would not offer the writer legal funding assistance because the writer broke the publication ban. I think that he was fully aware of what he was doing and should have to suffer the consequences for unlawfully breaking the publication ban. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE> &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ugly and unfair situation and I seriously hope this never happens to me, or any of you -- whether its a paper, book, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would sue. I would compile all of my written work, as well as any research (references, etc.) and try provide as much evidence as I could to try to persuade the court. Since this other writer's past work is awful compared to the book, it also would be beneficial to compare the eccentric writer's work to my own past work. I would try my hardest not to let this egomaniac get away with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would seriously consider any and all negative impacts that this may have on my community. I would perhaps talk with a few of the strict adherents, as well as the extremists, and get their opinions on the revisions of the stories. As a member of that religion, I wouldn't want to offend anyone. You can't please everyone, but you do want to make sure that the extremists won't retaliate too negatively. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was the poet and was eluded to the fact that my work was either incomplete or improper, I would try to go back the community and try to resolve the situation. I would speak directly to the members and listen to their concerns and suggestions. I would also be open to revising some of the myths and adding a few more and then possibly writing a second book. &lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a part of the writing process for someone else’s work is usually a pain-staking ordeal, especially if none of the credit is given to you. While working for a hockey magazine in North Vancouver two years ago as a co-editor to the publication, I had seen a lot of copy that appeared to be written by someone in elementary school. There was one particular contributor to the paper that had an atrocious writing style, which caused me to pull my hair out in frustration. Some of the time I would have to write an entirely new article for this individual and sign off using his byline. I will admit, I didn’t feel good about not getting the credit or the extra money, but it’s what I signed up to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to the main dilemma that the scenario poses, there isn’t a whole lot that you, a writer in financial trouble, can do in this particular case. Clearly the so-called “author” of the book has earned great revenue from the book sales over the past year. Unlike this particular writer, who struggles to pay the bills and has to work on side jobs to pick up some extra cash. However, the alternative is to offer a settlement (which would be less than the $50,000 he has put aside for legal purposes). Unless you have written proof stating that you assisted in the production of this book, there is no use trying to make a case in front of the judge. You will end up losing your own money, and valuable time that could be spent working on your own writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any university or college student can agree that writing historical essays or documents can be a bit tricky, especially if you can’t find the “golden document” that has all the information outlined. Most teachers, both in high school and post secondary institutes, often ask for a list of cited sources in order to ensure that the information expressed in the assignment isn’t simply copied and pasted from another source – otherwise known as plagiarism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the fact that it has now been 20 years since my “compelling” historical book has been published, it wouldn’t come as much of a shock if a lot of people have forgotten the details of my work. Hence, it would be a good idea to find out what sources the new author has used in his latest detective book. If he states that he took some of the ideas from my book, I can request that my name and book title be published within the credits section in his story. If he states he received the sources from documents that I had used when writing my book, then so be it. It’s been 20 years, I’m sure I have lots of money, I should just let it go and be happy that the issues and ideas expressed in my book are still being talked about two decades later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I come from a journalism background, I have seen a lot of cases where reporters have gotten information wrong or have misused information provided to them by certain authority figures. One thing that we were taught is to never piss off the wrong people (ex: people working in the RCMP or government figures). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this particular case, I (the one who invited the poet into the community) would obviously feel betrayed by the poet who didn’t go over the fine details of our myths with me before the piece was published. However, I would try to make the effort to correct the piece and have the books republished with the correct information. If this doesn’t happen, my community won’t have what it originally wanted – a written document of our myths to pass down to generations to come. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the poet, I would try to build up that connection again with one member of the community so that I can potentially build any bridges that have been broken. As long as the intensions are there to fix what has been done, at least the community can see that I’m trying to get the information straightened out. If this all goes well, I can possibly revise the information that was originally publish and allow the community to have what they asked for. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purely going on the basis that the organization I represent is to provide funding to individuals in situations exactly like this, I can’t imagine not providing the funding. As a journalist, I understand that publication bans are issued for a reason, but it’s very rare for certain elements of the trial to remain under publication ban AFTER the trial is complete (which is how I understand the situation). And as far as I know, it’s very rare for a publication ban to extend past the end of the trial. But once the trial is complete, I don’t understand why the ban would still be in place. I do not support censorship in writing, and an extended publication ban seems to be doing just that. Nobody is being forced to read this author’s work, so if they have a problem with the disturbing details, they don’t have to subject themselves to it. But literature and writing exist to intrigue, tell stories and push the boundaries. This is what this author is doing, by providing the public information regarding something that is arguably of public interest. I support providing this writer funding for his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would write the book the way I want to write the book. Maybe this is easier for me to say because I am not religious and I don’t understand the necessity of religion, but I could take a different approach to this question if I practiced. But all things considered that is offered in the question, I would personally have a reasoning for why I’m revisioning the stories, thus likely not making me a strict adherent or extremist. That alone would be enough of an incentive for me to write the novel I want to write. And as a writer, I obviously have to consider my audience, but realistically, it would be impossible to write about religion without offending somebody. I would imagine that, as somebody who practices said religion though, that would give me a lot more credence than some other author unfamiliar with our culture to write about it. This is part of Canada’s Right and Freedoms. I can understand that there are people out there who will be offended by what I write, but I will write what I am comfortable with, to a religious and cultural extreme that I am comfortable writing to. Because I don’t have a religious or feel a deep connection with my culture, this makes it harder for me to put myself in the writer’s shoes. But I would not censor myself to appease people who practice the same religion as I do. That’s not the point of writing. My opinions are just as valid as theirs, and the extremists are more than welcome to write a book about religion. For me though, I will not censor myself just because some people who practice my religion or are of the same cultural background as me will have a problem with my writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I know, there are copyright issues that have likely been breached in this case. As the author, I would likely feel offended and angry, as well as a bit of pride for having my work effectively launch another writer’s career. And I don’t think jealousy is a very good character trait to have as an author, which is how it would seem if I took legal action. This, I found, was the most challenging ethical situation because there aren’t a lot of options that work totally in my best interest. I would likely contact the author directly, and ask for an explanation. If, through direct contact with me, the author continues to claim that the ideas are original, then I would take legal action. At that point I would feel more confident in my argument, and would have less compassion for my fellow author (having lied to my face). I would take that personally, and, ethically speaking, I would know that him copying my ideas is much worse than me looking into the issue. I would also imagine that if my book did well 20 years earlier, I would not be the only one arguing my case. So to sum up, I wouldn’t initially seek legal action, rather, I would simply want an explanation from a fellow author. If, however, they lie to me, I would have no sympathy for them, and would then seek legal action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>2) For this case, I think it is depends on if I have sign any agreement with that author. I think if I have received any money or gifts from the author as it symbolize the payment of the editing, it is equals to I'm agree to sell my writing to him. It is give and take situation. It is not fair that I ask for more from the author just because the writing is being nominated or well-known in public. I think the solution of this case is that I should see this as a learning experience. It proves that I'm capable to write good and get compliment. Since knowledge and creativity is not transferable to anyone, I can still write difference genre to get famous or nominate. Looking forward and being positive are the key to success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) If that author did not mention or cited my work, I would have to ask for legal advices for further action. I may take my chance to sue the author since I think money should not be the problem for this case (personal case is easier). I think I will publish more book based on the same idea and make it more interesting and better. The reader would choose my work instead of his non-original work. I can produce more by my creativity, but he can only produce that only one piece just because of my research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I think I will not listen to any comment that is not objective and bias. Any writing has the good and bad side, and it won't be perfect for everyone to read. I think the people who give negative comment may due to jealousy of my success, and/or failure to see the topic in difference point of view. I may consider to filter the comments from the people but won't be turn down by them. If I think that partner with the poet is good at the first place, I would not change my mind after because of some obstacles. &lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&amp;quot;I think if I have received any money or gifts from the author as it symbolize the payment of the editing, it is equals to I'm agree to sell my writing to him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writers can sell a variety of rights, all the way up for work-for hire. I have a work-for-hire agreement with my workplace, for example -- everything I do on their time belongs to them and I have no claims over it. But writers can also get paid just for publication rights and still retain all other rights to their work -- the ability to sell different publication rights to the same work over and over again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the day when I was lamely trying to freelance, I was presented with a contract that was work-for-hire -- it said that I lost the rights to my work, even if they didn't publish it and pay me for it. Not being one to give away something for nothing, I backed out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as you say, it really depends on whether there is a written contract. In some jurisdictions, I think even a verbal contract is valid, if hard to prove.&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Ethical Dilemma 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Part of the organization's mandate is to provide assistance, including funding, to writers and artists who find themselves at odds with the legal systems and governments that do not recognize freedom of expression.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A publication ban does not exist to muzzle freedom of expression; it exists to protect the safety or reputation of a victim or witnesses who may otherwise be harmed by having their identity openly broadcasted in the press. Publication bans are often in place when the crime involves minors or is sexual. Given that the Canadian author knowingly broke the publication ban in a sensitive criminal case, not only does he not have any right to protection but also I don't think the organization, that supports rights and freedoms, has any legal ground to stand on. (What would be a huge deciding factor is if the books were published during the trial, or after. If they were during, then I understand why publication bans cannot be broken. But after??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, publication bans don't exist in the United States. So (assuming that we're talking about the guy who wrote the books about Homolka and Bernardo), it's interesting to take into account that, while the Canadian press could not publish details, the U.S. press could as it was protected by the First Amendment. Another point to consider was the publication ban was initially in place to ensure Bernardo's right to a fair trial. Many had an issue with this as it was considered outrageous that a monster required legal protection. I wonder if this is why the author went ahead and broke the publication ban, knowing that pubic opinion weighed in his favour?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch! What a horrible situation!&lt;br /&gt;I'm annoyed the struggling writer did not take any measures to protect him or herself from being burned. A contract or a letter of agreement should have been signed prior to working with the author. The author sounds like a bully and I would consult with a lawyer to see what rights I had. But since there was no written contract...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there's a quote out there about how there's no original ideas out there...&lt;br /&gt;What makes this dilemma particularly interesting is that 20 years have passed since the book has been published and, when it was published, it did well. It would be an entirely different scenario had the book recently been published.&lt;br /&gt;However, that does not dismiss the fact that plagiarism seems to be an issue. If this had happened to me, I would consult with a lawyer to find out how strong my case was. What would make my case noteworthy is the only thing I would be seeking is credit. No money, no damages. Just credit. I think, as an author, it would be my ethical responsibility to the writing world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>#2.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this could be taken in either of two ways. You could either &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take the loss and let the guy have his minute of fame because there is &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no way you would help him again therefore making it hard for him to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;write another book. Or, you could fight back and see if you can get any &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;credit through court for the story and at least bring others to the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;attention that this guy cannot write well making it hard for him to find &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;someone else write for him like you did for this book. The only problem &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with fighting the guy back in court could be that you could lose big and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then where would you be? I think I would probably just take it as a loss &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but somehow put it out there as a warning for the next guy that comes in &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to help this writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4.&lt;br /&gt;I don't know all the copyright rules but from what I understand I &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe you could fight this one as copyright. By showing the research &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you did with the obvious 20 year period between the two I think would &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;prove a really strong case towards this guy stealing your research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, today it seems that a lot of ideas come from past ideas and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;movies get remade ten or twenty years later that are almost identical &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but with better special effects and new actores. In today's society I &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just think a lot of things are being copied and it is hard to say how &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;far this guy went over the line without even more information about the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;situation. Overall, I would be really mad after how much time I put into &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my research and would definiately look into the copyright laws in this &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.&lt;br /&gt;I would get a meeting together with my community. From the sounds of &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this situation it souns like this is a close community and therefore &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should welcome open discussion about what they feel was wrong about what &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the poet did. I would then reinvite the poet back and talk about &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;revisiting the books with more contributions because it should involve &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the community as a whole. The books then would be like what occurs in &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;university where they get updated every year are so. I do not believe it &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would be an issue to do updates on this culture and just clarify it has &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;been because of further investigation of the culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were the poet I would do what I could to set things right and would &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;work with the family I originally worked with to help incorporate &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anything the community felt I missed. Nothing is ever set in stone and I &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;believe that this situation would be an easy one to fix to get a better &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;story across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;#3 I believe in this case you stay true to yourself. As writers, I believe that we need to focus less on what everybody else thinks and focus more on expressing ourselves and our beliefs. If the person working on the novel takes issue with the blasphemous religious stories, then he or she should refrain from working on the novel. However, if this person considers himself or herself a moderate, then he or she should continue working on the novel. Regarding this ethical issue, my main conclusion is that the person should do what he or she feels is right, not what is going to please the religious community that he or she lives in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4 I would first confront the author of this new book and present my claims. If he does not believe me or is unwilling to admit that he has stolen my ideas, then I would take matters further, taking the person to court or suing them.&lt;/p&gt;#5 I would agree with the grumbling members of the town. Cultural myths and stories are not something that should be altered, not even slightly. They are something that have been engrained in your culture and passed on from generation to generation. When you begin to change small details, that can slowly begin to affect the meaning of the stories. As a poet, I would hope that he would apologize for the mistake, and say that it was unintentional. In turn I would make a public statement correcting the misinformation. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;1.I would support him getting the grant because I think it is important that things especially criminal cases be presented to the public. Things that the media presents to us are usually so muted and changed that rarely do we get the full story. I'm assuming the story he is talking about is relevant to society and of interest to them, and supported with privileged court documents they probably offer some new insights into the crimes. Just because the details are disturbing does not mean that we have no right to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. This story is so frustrating, If the award wasnt involved I think I would just take it as a loss because if the book is so incedible a followup would probably be expected, but the &amp;quot;author&amp;quot; would not be able to write anything decent. Although coming forward after an award would seem like a cry for attention so I'm not quite sure I would do that eiteher. I would seek legal counsel I suppose, but I don't think I would really have many options as it is hard to fight a he said she said battle, especially if the other party is well known, and now critically acclaimed. At least after the whole incident I would know that I was a capable writer and would probably be more motivated to get my own work published, in the hopes that one day I would surpass his successes. And then perhaps at the summit of my success I would bust out with a &amp;quot;oh yeah, I wrote that too&amp;quot; ;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.I would write it how I wanted to. I think it is important that religion is presented from all angles, there are extremeist books out there, and although I don't agree with everything they say, I have no problem with their publication. Publishing a &amp;quot;controversial&amp;quot; book on religion would breed conversation and perhaps open peoples minds to different ways of thinking about something that they have been force fed. . &lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>D1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm a journalism major so I'm admittedly one-sided on this. I don't&lt;br /&gt;think think that the writer should receive the grant or any support at&lt;br /&gt;all. When you've looking at freedom of expression vs. publication bans,&lt;br /&gt;you have to consider whether the information is benefitting the public.&lt;br /&gt;In this example, it seems like the writer is exploiting the trial for&lt;br /&gt;his own benefit. On top of that, there are reasons for publication bans.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the writer, the trial could have been swayed not to mention&lt;br /&gt;the insensitivity directed towards the potential victims' families. I&lt;br /&gt;don't believe he's being persecuted and he should be dealt with strictly&lt;br /&gt;to discourage future writers from trying to exploit the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I wouldn't have written an entire book without documentation&lt;br /&gt;of the work that I put into it. Secondly, I don't take kindly to&lt;br /&gt;threats. I would go ahead with the truth to any media outlet I could and&lt;br /&gt;do everything in my power to get revenge for the threats. Libel doesn't&lt;br /&gt;exist if there is proof that you are speaking the truth. It helps my&lt;br /&gt;case if the author clearly can't write. If that failed I'd loosen the&lt;br /&gt;lug nuts on his car so that the wheels would fall off while he's driving&lt;br /&gt;or clip the brake lines. Yes it' s childish, yes it's murder, but there&lt;br /&gt;are far too many terrible writers in the world. Never negotiate with&lt;br /&gt;bullies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case it sounds as if the positive influence that the book would&lt;br /&gt;have on the moderate readers would outweigh the negative feelings that&lt;br /&gt;the extremists would have. I have a really hard time with extremists&lt;br /&gt;because for me the most important thing is to be open minded. That said,&lt;br /&gt;I would be worried about any repercussions so I would use a pen name and&lt;br /&gt;never go on a book tour. Yes, they're probably bullies too, but a cranky&lt;br /&gt;old man waving money at me is alot different than someone killing me. On&lt;br /&gt;a more personal level, my entire family is very religious and even&lt;br /&gt;though I believe in alot of the criticism I direct towards their religion,&lt;br /&gt;I would never let them read it or ever publish anything with my real&lt;br /&gt;name on it. I decided my pen name years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Ethical Dilemmas&lt;br /&gt;By Christopher Poon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the writer should receive the grant. I don’t believe that it’s up to anyone to decide whether or not the details are too disturbing to be published. Let the book be out there and allow people to make their own decisions on if they want to read it or not. If the documents are being leaked, then I believe it’s fair game and the author should be allowed to publish the books. The writer should receive the financial assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is tricky because you should rightfully stand up for yourself, but in this case, it could mean financial ruin. I think that the risk is still worth pursuing the issue, as you have more evidence to discredit him than he has you. The poorly-written letter only serves as further proof that he is incapable of having written the book. I would go to the press with my claims, as it may set in motivate a lot more people to investigate the possibility of the writer not actually having done the work. After that, I’d wait and see what the writer does, if he ends up pursuing legal action or admitting that he did not do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take my issues to the author first, and see what his response is. If he accepts that he did in fact rip-off my work, I would demand a public declaration and residuals from the book. If he denies anything of the sort, I would go with the same response as dilemma two, and take it to the press. I would publicly inquire how exactly his research was conducted, and encourage the press and public to look at the two works and make up their own minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Now &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;that's&lt;/span&gt; a poorly constructed title: &amp;quot;It's been pretty quiet...&amp;quot; I spot at least three compositional weaknesses in those four words. But the statement is true: this week's forum has been silent, vacuuous, cavernously taciturn. I assume this means that everyone is working on other things (for other courses). That's fine; I recognize that as the semester progresses, everyone gets a bit busier with each passing week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here's the thing: the content for next week -- the &amp;quot;start working on your final project&amp;quot; week -- will be based on what you indicate, in this week's forum, will be useful to you. So, post something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's give it a few days, perhaps until Monday or Tuesday, before moving on to next week. Would that help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ross&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Thanks for the extra days, Ross. My third composition is a story I started, oh, almost 10 years ago so it should be an interesting process to pick it up again. I haven't revisited the story at all in the last few years so I expect it will be a bit of a challenge to finish (I stopped working on it because I ran into a bit of an ethical issue).&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> A basic rule is: never revise, always recreate. See Carlos Fuentes' The Orange Tree (and many other books) for discussion on this topic. Recreations are always better, for many reasons (take an IDEA class to find out all those reasons!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not worked on this narrative in several years, I recommend -- in the strongest terms -- that you burn it. You will otherwise be shackled to this other you, the you who created this narrative and who no longer inhabits your life. Do you want to return to that person? Think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life moves forward. So should writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sounds harsh, perhaps. But the creative is a force, a true and authentic force, and it does not like to be pushed along trodden paths. The creative force always seeks the new, the fresh, the uninhabited country. If we want to ride with it, we should accept this and learn, sometimes, to burn things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Oh, that's really interesting! I'd never heard of recreating over revisions before and, to be honest, that's a huge load off my shoulders. I think so many years have passed without me touching the story because I just didn't want to be back in that frustrating headspace. I want to write the story, and this is a freer approach. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>It may just be me, but I'm a little confused as to how the personal essay differs from the other two assignments. I have written a travelogue and a memoir, and I understand that none of the criteria defining the three are set in stone, but could you maybe elaborate a little more on what exactly the personal essay is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kyle&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <SUBJECT>Re: Personal Essay</SUBJECT>
                <MESSAGE> There is no true difference between any of the genres (fiction, nonfiction, poetry, etc.). All are faces of art. Take an IDEA class to learn more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with specific focus on our assignments, here are a couple of suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Write a third piece. I do not care whether it is, technically, from another genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Read my piece on the personal essay:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://rosslaird.info/node/1181&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Another version of this is posted for an earlier week of the course.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The narrative does not have to be about you! Write about a dog, or a house, or a tree (http://rosslaird.info/node/1181), or a bit of detritus you find at the roadside. It does not matter; all things are connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. As a consequence of point 3: start where you are. Right now. Look around at what you see. Start here and now. Example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toward the horizon, the broad limbs of a fir tree stretch out from a&lt;br /&gt;trunk still black against the morning sky. The indigo dawn brightens&lt;br /&gt;toward vermilion. A scatter of skeletal branches extends on the south&lt;br /&gt;side of the tree, high up. Beneath these and northward, a mass of&lt;br /&gt;counterbalanced foliage swings above the creek. Branches at the&lt;br /&gt;tangled summit render the shape of a bird in a nest. Perhaps it is a&lt;br /&gt;bird, not merely branches. At this distance it's too hard to tell. The&lt;br /&gt;trunk slowly rocks in the freshening wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lower down, stands of dense cedar and scrubby fir punctuate the rising&lt;br /&gt;landscape. The geography is spare in this light: hidden rills and&lt;br /&gt;derelict fences blend into the land's soft, woolen texture. A scrim of&lt;br /&gt;cloud obscures the dawn for a moment, then moves off. Wind from the&lt;br /&gt;bay slides across hills warmed by the rising sun. I scan overhead,&lt;br /&gt;looking for the first wing-borne travelers of the day, but I do not&lt;br /&gt;yet see them. I hear a single call, far off and forlorn, but nothing&lt;br /&gt;more. Perhaps the tide is in flood along the crescent of the bay, and&lt;br /&gt;the submerged flats offer nothing yet for the black and scavenging&lt;br /&gt;birds to find. Perhaps they have been delayed by scattered rain&lt;br /&gt;along the lee of the hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Fiction and nonfiction exist on a continuum of truth. Each has aspects of the other. In the gap between them, creativity inserts itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: you may have fictional elements, but you must also have nonfictional elements in your narrative. (After all, the course has the word &amp;quot;nonfiction&amp;quot; in its title.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between fact and truth is not the same as the difference between fiction and nonfiction. Think about it: what is truth?&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Well, I have started some work on the final project, and it is shaping up to be a longer work. Currently, I am at about 700 words, and I feel that I have just scratched the surface of what I'm trying to get at. I am going to write about a memoir about a friendship that I had - it's quite an unsual story, actually, and one that I think would be an interesting read for most people. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;br /&gt;Memoirs of friendship are a storied tradition in both fiction and nonfiction writing (I'm thinking of Borges and his story Funes the Memorius). Just try to avoid anything that sounds too much like all the regular friendship tropes. This can be tough to do, but is worthwhile. Find the one true thing lying beneath the veneer of the narrative. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>My last genre I have left to write is my memoire.  I want to write about a difficult time in my life, both for my family and myself, my parents divorce.  When writing there are a couple things I struggle with and completely have to remind myself to do.  First of all, tense, especially when writing about the past I find it very hard to take a more active present tense.  Second, is removing myself from the story and becoming the author.  Third, adding detail.  I'm referring to detail such as colours and setting.  I tend to focus on the main plot, but forget about the details that truly enrich the story.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>So: make all the improvements you describe above. If you can articulate them, you can craft them. Stay in the perennial present tense (read Under the Influence again, if you have not already done so). Also, forget that you are the author. Don't use this piece to explain anything to yourself, or to the reader. Don't try to therapize the narrative. Try to see the situation dispassionately, as though you were an observer high in the sky, remote and viewing with the clarity of distanced compassion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: You are not the story. </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>So for the past week and a half I've really been struggling with brainstorming a final project idea. Regardless, I think that I've finally come up with a subject that I'm very passionate about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about two years ago I decided to see my family doctor after suffering from a variety of symptoms (feeling light headed, having a shortness of breath, racing heart etc.). Within two hours of getting a blood test at a local clinic, I received a phone call from a medical lab telling me that I needed to go to a hospital right away to receive a blood transfusion (in the end I actually had three). Long story short, I was in the hospital for almost a week and was labeled as a &amp;quot;medical mystery case&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to write about my day-by-day experiences and the adversity I faced in order to have a speedy recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any thoughts?&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, sounds like a good topic. But here's the key: no exclamation points, no exclamations. Tell it as though you were a reporter and the story is you. Be direct and dispassionate about yourself while also reflecting on your struggle. This is actually quite tricky to do. See &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/span&gt; for an excellent example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Hey Ross and anyone who chooses to read this,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I've been working on this short story for about six months now, and I'd love to be able to use it for my composition 3. For the most part it is fictional, however there are many aspects of it which are not. So...I'm open to any suggestions and comments that any of you have. At this point, the story feels slightly rushed and corny, and I'd like to change into something more real. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sarah&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Just keep going. Let the piece shape itself. Find the authentic voices of these scenes and let them tell you how to shape the words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work on your tendency to try to say too much in one sentence, and to use dialog when description would be of more use. Reduce the dialog by ten percent, or increase the description by twenty percent. Watch for loose words -- words that can be taken out without negating the meaning of the sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep going...&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>Yes, coming along. See my response to Caprice in this forum for the caution about these types of narratives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: watch for words ending in -ly, watch for extra words, and remove all instances of the word &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/span&gt;. It's not a writerly word. Use a more accurate and descriptive word. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Stupid&lt;/span&gt; is like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;very&lt;/span&gt;: these words don't tell us anything. (Can a bra strap be stupid?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also look for -- and try to find replacements for -- words such as bit, like, because, so, those, never. In general, these words are more properly the domain of speech and not of writing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep going...&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE> Blind Impulse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have claw marks on my heart. Even though they remain unseen, it’s impossible to sustain countless savage emotional slashings and remain scar free. They are there because of rouge lipped vixens and blue-eyed sirens who broke me in a long time ago. And like a cowboy riding a bronco in a rodeo, I hold on for as long as I can before I am bucked into the dirt. My longest and most painful ride was for six years. But my times get cut swiftly shorter to six month stints after that, sometimes six weeks and sometimes six days. Like a true cowboy I keep getting back on the horse, even before I have time to heal. The result is a broken-down boy covered in internal scars and a beat up heart. More specifically, just like Romeo in the beginning of Shakespeare’s play. Before he meets Juliet, when he’s being a pussy, moping around like a whimpering dog. This is me, until a friend puts a bright idea into my gloomy head. There is this dating site, Christian site specifically, and I can weed through the ugly girls and psychos without even having to get to know them in person. A neat and tidy perfect solution, I dive in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step is to set up an account. We do this carefully because we don’t want to attract the wrong type of fish. It’s not exactly about lying, but embellishment is a key component in the business of internet profiles. I smoke, drink excessively and I am a skinny journalism student. This translates into a non-smoker, social drinker, and athletic build journalist. Done. I troll for fish and I get hits; mostly crazy, boring or stupid fish. After a few weeks of continually drab conversations, I get one from a girl named Danni near the beginning of May. She is a petite blonde with beautiful eyes, multiple tattoos and amazing tits. More importantly she is a Christian. In spite of my gritty lifestyle this is important to me, as it tends to balance me out and satisfy the one criteria that my conservative parents have for girlfriend approval. Instantly I trip and fall for Danni. Over the phone and online we connect like Lego pieces in a plastic masterpiece. I am smitten. By the end of the month I have made arrangements to fly to Alberta to stay at her house in her small town. I am a love-seeking missile and I’m locked and loaded, targeting. My life is perfect. I blissfully float through workdays and the week until I receive a call from Danni one night. Only it isn’t a girl’s voice it is a guy. He wants to know who the fuck I am; I want to know who the fuck he is. He says that he is Danni’s boyfriend, I laugh and tell him to eat shit. He tells me that he is going to kill me. I tell him where I live and dare him too try it, calling him a pussy. Then cockily, I tell him that I’m coming to Alberta and tell him that if I see him, I’m going to cut his fucking throat. I tell him to give the phone to Danni; he tells me she’s not there. I hang up. My idiotic phone smile fades and I am irrepressibly pissed off. I furiously burn through a cigarette and go inside. I check my emails and there is a new one from Danni telling me that her ex-boyfriend showed up at the bar and stole her phone. She begs me not to be mad, there is nothing going on, he is just an asshole. I can breath a sigh of relief. The next day she calls me and reassures me extensively, I tell her that she needs to be more careful. The butterflies in my stomach reappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the incident, the days tick away and my excitement works into a schoolboy frenzy by the time the flight day comes. I trim by facial hair into a perfect five o’clock shadow. I trim my armpit hair and shave my balls into porn star precision. Perfection is all in the details. I pack my favorite knife in my check luggage, just in case I run into an asshole. The same friend who initiated me into the online world drives me to the airport. My heart races and I can’t keep the ridiculous smile off my face on the way to YVR. We arrive and he cuts me loose to fend for myself on my impulsive love conquest. Worry sets in slightly on the flight. What if she is a whale? What if she is a killer? The fears hang in the air, unresolved until I can see her for myself. The flight lands, I exit, weak-kneed walking to the luggage drop. I grab my bags and feel for my phone in my breast pocket. I call her and the phone rings and rings until a nervous voice answers the phone. She tells me to look straight across the lobby. Our eyes connect and we both saunter towards each other simultaneously clicking our phones shut. She is sexier and has a more voluptuous smile than I had imagined. I have my own personal pretend-punk Barbie. We hug nervously and grin at each other. We look like a more attractive, less drug addled Sid and Nancy walking together in the night towards the parking garage. We load into the truck and she drives, both of us still too nervous to form coherent sentences, so we just beam like Cheshire cats. One of us suggests a nightcap at a bar to lighten the air of nervousness. We drive until we see a dimly lit Asian-fusion corner bar in Edmonton. Sitting across from each other in the half-dark red tinted light we drink and I find enough courage to start making moves. I tell her she’s beautiful, playing the cute card that I keep up my sleeve for deal sealing. I can see in her eyes that she’s fallen for me, at least on the surface. We pay and leave the bar hand in hand. She comes to my side of the truck and I kiss her soft lip-glossed lips and push her back up against the door. We smile after, noses touching, and then we climb into her Ford. The night is warm and dry. In the clear Albertan air the stars shine over us and the farmers fields that line the sides of the long straight freeway. I slide to the middle seat and take her small feminine shoulders in my arm and we listen to the dreary love songs on the stereo. Perfection is prevailing. We get to her house and creep passed her sleeping roommate’s door into hers. We make-out, she slides my belt off and I stop her saying that we should maybe wait, telling her that we don’t have to rush things. Not saying this because I want to, simply because I feel that it should be said. She disagrees and we fuck, not making love in any way. We lay on our backs after, sweaty and sticking to the sheets, and we talk about life. Bulimia comes up; she says she has been fighting it. I tell her it’s ok. I try to make her feel better so I mention my insomnia and semi-craziness. She thinks it is cute, but I don’t. I smile regardless. We light a cigarette, the smoke drifts out of the window into the farm fresh air like an afterglow incense. The smell of smoke and fresh dirt mixes in the warm darkness. She cuddles up to my warm bare chest and falls asleep. Staring at the ceiling, I wonder why I still don’t feel complete. I tell myself that it will come later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week flies by like the summer breeze. She decides that everything is going so perfectly, that we should get a tattoo together. If I’m actually serious, she says. I man up and decide to do it. After all, I have a badass reputation to uphold. I sketch a simple heart and a banner with initials for a bible verse that says something about love being as strong as death. S-S-8-6, coincidentally the same initials and birth year as a girl I used to have a crush on. I keep that fact to myself. We skip hand in hand to the tattoo parlor and the artist inks us on the same arm. After, he wraps respective blue and pink bandages on our arms to keep the blood and ink from staining our shirts. Hopefully I actually love her, because this isn’t like a picture I can throw away. This may be the most impulsive decision I have ever made. Everything is practically perfect, practically. One afternoon while watching a movie she drinks a can of Dr.Pepper. I ask her for a sip and she declines. I plead and she thrusts the can at me. I take a sip and recognize the taste of rum, straight. I get irritated at her apparent alcoholic tendencies. She talks me down. I let it pass. Later, we drink more and she disappears into the bathroom. She takes a while so I ask loudly if she is doing ok. No answer. I knock on the door. No answer. I pop the door open a crack and see her with her hands on the bowl, heaving. I walk out and sit back on the bed. She enters and I ask her if she was binging. She tells me that she just drank too much. I let it pass. Then she sits me down and says that she has to get something off of her chest. She was actually dating someone, the phone asshole, while she was making plans with me. It is over now and she tells me that she loves me. She just needed to tell me the truth. I thank her and let it pass. Sometimes you have to ignore a few of the beastly aspects if you want the beauty. She is perfect enough I say. I ignore the warnings like a child with his fingers in his ears saying: la la la la la, I can’t hear you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s time for my week in wonderland to come to a close. I drive to the airport with her, her eyes already beginning to mist. I put sad sappy songs on for the ride, to make it more movie-like. Outside of the terminal she squeezes me as tight as her little girly arms can, and tears stream down her face, upsetting her perfectly applied make-up. She swears that she will be coming to see me as soon as possible. She says she can barely handle the separation even now. We both say I love you, the words slip from my mouth awkwardly, but she cannot tell. I keep telling myself that the words will get easier over time. One has to practice at anything; love doesn’t always come naturally. Sometimes you have to work at it. I step onto the plane and listen to sad-sack anthems on the flight home trying to retain the beautiful melancholy in my head like Tupperwared leftovers. As soon as I arrive home, she calls me and tells me she needs to be with me. By the end of the summer she wants to move to Vancouver. Over the next week plans evolve and I’m caught off guard by their hurricane-like speed. She wants to move to Vancouver and find a roommate soon. The she wants to move in with me instead. Then she wants to move in with me now. Half way through June, we have our own place in Cloverdale. I just beat my own record for impulsive behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We have about a week until our season of storms starts. Sex is unbelievable, money is fine and the food is great. Then she has trouble finding a job. Life is still fine; I just work more to make up for her until she can find something. She lands consecutive waitressing jobs but decides that she can do better, so she skips multiple training sessions. The options roll in but if she has to wear sleeves to cover tattoos, she refuses the job. If they can only offer afternoon shifts, she refuses. If it’s not goddamned perfect, she refuses. Her lack of job equates into lack of money, which bubbles into her being depressed. She needs to buy things to make her happy. All isn’t quiet on the western front. Coming home from work begins to turn into a chore for me. I have to perk up and wake up the beautiful blond sloth that I live with everyday after work. She has her mom ship her high dosage Prozac. Things are going to be ok I think. Once the Prozac kicks in, we will be as happy as pigs in shit. She starts taking the pills and instead of laying off booze like the directions say, we have a little anniversary dinner with wine. She assures me that a sip will not hurt anyone. Wrong. After a few glasses, the alcohol and pills mix, releasing a well-hidden monster. After countless glasses, she sloshily tells me how much she resents me now and marches over to the cabinet for food to binge on. I follow and slap her hand away, telling her that I won’t let her fall back into addiction. As an alternative she grabs a kitchen knife and points it at my neck. The blue Ikea handle sits awkwardly in her little hand and there is a look of drunken madness stuck to her face. I react, poorly. I call her a fucking crazy bitch and dare her to cut me. She backs down and instead yells that she’ll cut her arms into ribbons. I grab her tiny ineffectual wrist and she screams at me. The knife is forced out of her fingers and I release her. She runs to our bedroom, slamming the door twice to make a childish point. Rationality takes hold of me and I collect all of the knives and sharp tools in the house, throw them under the couch and retire for the night. Sometime after midnight, she shuffles out, and apologetically climbs onto the couch with me. She cries and tells me she’s sorry. I carry her to bed and fall into a delirious sleep, suppressing my anxiousness. This is not what I signed up for. I don’t think that this is the girl I fell for on my adventure in Alberta. Something is wrong and it is quickly deteriorating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The next few weeks are a rollercoaster ride of happiness and hate, but I act strong and patient. I exist like a fuckable doormat, riding the waves of sheer insanity. I miss my friends who I haven’t seen in far too long, but I feel obligated to attend to my crazy girlfriend. I decide to bring her out with my crew, fingers crossed for the best. We drive downtown and I tell her she shouldn’t drink if she’s going to turn into Mrs. Hyde. She tells me that it will be fine. We go over to my friend’s house to have a few drinks before the bar. I get tipsy; she gets tipsy. Everything is still under control. We take a taxi to the bar. My other punk-ass friends are there with my Suicide Girl friends. SG’s are a group of burlesque punk chicks that pose in crazy softcore porn. They are amazing, but unpredictable. Two of the girl lean over and tell me that they want to have sex with my girlfriend. I tell them to go to hell. Like a shark in open water I can already sense trouble like blood. Danni starts to drink more because she thinks that they don’t like her, I tell her that they just wanted to get with her. I tell her that they think she is sexy. We laugh and drink it off…and keep drinking. My other friend offers me some coke in the bathroom; I decline and come to a terrible conclusion. This is no place for a small town Alberta girl. I am now drunk, but coherent enough to realize this. She is not accustomed to the sinister side of town with the people I associate with. Crazies and badass motherfuckers roam free like wolves in a feeding frenzy here. I zip up and leave the bathroom to gather her and the two friends that I came with. I look around. The boys are there, but where the hell are the girls. My friend tells me that they went into the bathroom together. Fuck, this is not good. Danni emerges a drunken mess and tells me she kissed a girl in the bathroom. Ok, it’s time to leave. We all stumble outside, my brain is intact, but my legs are drunk. There are too many of us now and we have to take two cabs. One for me and my friend, one for Danni and the other two girls…and oh shit, a forty of Jack Daniels. This is escalating into a full-fledged disaster. In the short ride I tell my friend that Danni is on meds and I warn him that this could end up a complete mess, one that I am too tired to deal with. He tells me that I am overreacting and that I need to calm down. We get to his house and another beer is placed in my hands to settle my nerves. The girls arrive and all three go straight to a bedroom. I get upset and leave with my beer; my friend tails me. He calms me down again, and we go back. I decide to get blind drunk and everything turns into an alcoholic haze. Someone gives Danni coke; she gets jacked-up and starts yelling. One of the girls starts crying about her life. I turn on Easy Rider to zone out. My friend punches a hole in the wall and leaves. I find a girl’s bike and ride around the neighborhood in the rain looking for my friend. I find a lost cat and carry it around with me. Danni leaves to look for both of us. I go back, leave the cat outside and pass out in the only bed. One of the girls passes out beside me. Danni comes back, collapses out cold on the floor in the kitchen. My friend passes out at Kits beach. Everyone is drunk, dirty and unhappy. This should be the end. Unfortunately I’m a glutton for punishment and it isn’t. The sun will come up tomorrow, and hopefully things will change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The next day, nursing hangovers we fight about the night. I cave, but I need a breather. I plan on going to Seattle the next week to visit my best friend and regroup. A bit of the old group drinking therapy with my party brothers always does the brain and body good. I thought that I loved this girl but I think I’ll kill her if I don’t get a break from her. We bicker back and forth throughout the week, but I just double dose my insomnia medication and black out to avoid the fights. We are crashing and the chance of survival is getting slimmer. We are going down, down, down like a fiery fighter pilot. The morning before I am about to leave, she tells me that she needs me to stay and that we can’t last if I go. I tell her that we can’t survive if I stay. This escalates into a brutal Hiroshima degree fight, ending with me telling her that there was a time when I used to love her and slamming the door, leaving her to clean up my fallout. I am on the road to the border and my phone keeps ringing, getting bombarded with texts from the she-devil. I turn it off. July fourth is in full effect and it is time to party the frustration away. Over the course of the night I pop pills, drink countless beers and howl into the night. I wake up the next morning, propped in a leather recliner. I survey the scene and discover firework burns on my shirt, a future burn scar on my chest and a gunpowder black hand. The night was a success, almost to the point of forgetting the mosquito-like nagging at the back of my brain. I turn on my phone for the first time since leaving. Message after message pours onto the screen. A vicious circle of hates, loves, bastards and sweeties appears in the inbox and I’m overwhelmed by dozens of messages. I decide to call her. She apologizes, and tells me to come home. I refuse, and tell her I’ll deal with her the next day. I can hear the violence rising in her little voice. I hang up and turn my phone off again. I plan on partying, but the nagging is unshakable. On top of that I start to worry that she will do something rash. Considering her track record, this is a sure thing. I wait it out, but at midnight I decide to drive back to my own house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stepping into my living room, I expect to find Danni moping. Instead I find an empty wine bottle, empty beer cans and my younger sister’s purse. Apparently my sister felt bad that Danni was home so she decided to get drunk with her and take her downtown. I call my sister and that familiar creeping fear climbs up legs into my throat. My sister tells me that she took Danni out with my ex-girlfriend. Strike one. They all got drunk. Strike two. Then she tells me that Danni is making out with some random guy. Strike three. I am tired of playing this game anyways. My sister can’t even tell me how sorry she is, and she asks me what she should do. I calmly tell her to go to hell and warn her not to bring Danni anywhere near me. The next moment is crucial. Do I destroy her stuff and slash her truck tires? No, that would be pointless. Besides, I can probably break her spirit instead. I decide to pack her stuff for her, to get her out as soon as possible. I neatly stack everything that belongs to her in the living room, take a sleeping pill and pass out. The next morning I wake up to my sister knocking on the door. Danni didn’t go home with her. Who cares, it’s over I tell her. I don’t even care if she is dead at this point; I just want her gone. I call her brother, who calls her mom and within hours she has booked a ticket to fly out and pick up her hell-spawn. Danni strolls into the house at some point in the afternoon. Her hair is disheveled, and she looks like she slept in a garbage can. I can’t tell whether she screwed some random asshole or whether she slept on the street, but the answer isn’t something I’m searching for at this point. She tells me that I have no idea how bad her night was. Then she asks me why all of her things are on the floor. I tell her that we’re done, for good. She tries to convince me to talk to her, but I refuse flatly. She tries to hug me and I tell her not to touch me. I would rather have a butcher chop my fingers off and feed them to me than ever touch her sick skin again. At this point I decide that my cold shoulder is not enough. I lie that I had bought her an engagement ring and that I was going to propose before she ruined any chance of redemption. I know how obsessed with getting married she is and I know this will break her. She balls her eyes out, like Alice did when she fell down the rabbit hole. I brush passed her and grab an overnight bag, filling it with things that I don’t want smashed or stolen. A walk outside to my friend’s car and we go and see an early movie. The movie was ok, but I think the last one I watched after breaking up with a girl was better. I realize that I probably never loved either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once she finally moves out, I go back home, bracing for destruction. Surprisingly the damage is not as severe as I thought it would be. She left all of out pictures, with my head cut out every single one. Also, she stabbed my couch twenty-five times, impressively breaking the blade off in the frame. Better it than me. Over the next few months I live alone and love life again. I wasted an entire summer, I have a permanent tattoo and now I’m stuck in a lease. Oh well, could have been worse. She calls me incessantly telling me how much she still loves me and begs me for another chance. I shut her down like a sniper blasting an unarmed enemy every time. No more psychos for me, I don’t need any more holes. Eventually the calls stop because she finds an even bigger doormat. She gets engaged a month after her last call. I’m bone broke and alone but at least I never got shot with the marriage bullet. You live and learn, and I learned that you shouldn’t move in with a girl you’ve only known for a month. Who would have known? This is merely a speed bump on my interstate. At this point, there are far too many scars on my heart to really feel the new ones anyways. It’s callous and rough and I can’t imagine any other way to live. Time to get back up on that horse. Next…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>It started as harmful teasing between a group of 11-year-olds. We were young and naïve, prejudicial; to be blunt, we were cruel. But we were also best friends, so the jokes were undermined by heartfelt compassion. We were well past the awkward threshold in the friendship where it was now okay to joke about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only cartilage. There was an abundance of it that had grown around Trevor’s heart, but it made him look lopsided; it made him look like he had one poorly developed C-cup breast. So we teased him about it. We mostly joked about his inevitable difficulty shopping for bras, but it was all in good fun. He took it like a man, and he amiably reciprocated the gesture: he teased me about my Jewish nose and my disproportionately small head—I grew into my physical features though, he didn’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time we were 15, Trevor had taken more than his fair share of abuse all thanks to his left breast, so he went in for surgery. It was routine, it only took a couple hours, and it leveled out his chest. To this day, he argues that the reason he went in for surgery was because of our incessant ridiculing; I’m not all that convinced that’s the truth. The surgery was scheduled at an opportune time for any high school student: one of the last days before school ends on the morning before our Social Studies final exam. He lucked out and convinced our instructor that, because of his high mark in the class already, he didn’t need to take the final exam. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was jealous. Not only because he missed a final exam and the last week of classes during his recovery, but he got a lot of attention from his friends. I didn’t have an overly dramatic high school life, so I never had an opportunity to find out who was a true friend; I was never confrontational enough to call someone out, and a situation never arose that would allow me to see who really cared. And it was a mix of these emotions, on top of visits to the hospital where I saw my friend spend a week being tended to, eating whatever he wanted and watching endless hours of TV, that made me wish to be hospitalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make it clear that my wish isn’t as terrible as it sounds; I don’t want to be ill or hurt, I just see hospitalization as a sort of a vacation. It’s like going to an all-inclusive resort or being on a cruise ship where the staff caters to your every whim; it’d be a chance for me to step away from the normalcy of my life for a bit. Trevor described his hospital experience very similarly, time away from the stresses of school and life. And to add a little more credence to my wish, I’m an identical twin who has spent his entire life living in the shadow of “the perfect son”. I have spent my life being compared to somebody that everyone expects me to be identical to in every way. I have been the lesser-appreciated afterthought of “the Slavin twins” all my life, and it’s insulting. So it’s not that I crave attention, I’ve lived essentially without it since we’ve been students, but there comes a point when you realize that you need to be noticed, if only fleetingly, just to see who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not a religious person whatsoever, but I picked up an unusual quirk as a child. My parents come from different backgrounds (my mother is Catholic, my father is Jewish), but I was not raised with religion in my life. There were the odds moments when my mom would mention prayer or church, but that was almost the extent of my religious upbringing. Somehow though, I got into a mindset at the age of 7 that I could pray to God and he’ll listen to me. Sadly, this quirk developed from my watching Angels in the Outfield, where such a situation occurs, but it became a constant in my life whenever I wanted something. I wouldn’t kneel down at the edge of my bed and speak in eloquent, religious verse to God, rather, I would say, “God, please let me see what it’s like to be hospitalized. I don’t want to be really sick or really hurt, but let me experience it at some point.” I wouldn’t even throw in an “Amen.” Even on nights when I have difficulties falling asleep, I would ask Him to help me get to sleep. So in June 2003, after seeing my best friend go in for surgery and spend a week in the hospital recovering, I lay in bed one restless night and wished that God would somehow, someway, hospitalize me. And boy, did He deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Halloween. I’m 16 years old, which means I’m past the age of going out dressed up and collecting candy. It’s a Friday night and there’s no school in the morning, so I can have a bit of fun tonight. Trevor comes over before we’ve decided what we’re going to do this evening. We toss a few ideas around, but we ultimately decide on hiding in the bushes at my front door so we can jump out and scare trick or treaters. We spend the next four hours in the chilly fall air, dressed in black—I couldn’t find my black sweater, so I only have a black T-shirt on, but I hide my arms well enough as the children approach that they won’t notice me. Spending the night scaring is a much more entertaining, and lasting way to get through Halloween than walking around the neighbourhood to collect boxes of raisins or bite-sized Oh Henry’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a wonderfully rewarding night. I bear the cold because it’s worth every flux of expression on the neighbourhood-goers’ faces. That momentary flit of horror that passes over their eyes is uncannily real. We see the bravery and the cowardice in the contortions of their brow, the quick pang of uncertainty because a hand just wrapped itself around their ankle. Trevor and I use discretion; we have age restrictions for who we scare, but the odd parent gets mad at us anyways: “Don’t you have anything better to do than to scare children?” Tonight, in our juvenile, possibly immature eyes, there really is nothing better to do on Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I needed was a sweater, and it might’ve ended differently. The flu struck me Sunday morning, and I was recovering well by the start of the week. I plow on through, mostly, but I have to miss an English exam Tuesday afternoon because the sickness hit me hard again. After a good night’s sleep I feel as healthy as ever, but I run into my English teacher, who tells me that I have to take yesterday’s English exam tomorrow morning. I’m not concerned though, I’ve aced literary terms exams in the past, so this one should be a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s Thursday morning, 8:50. I’m sitting on top of the second-floor lockers outside of my English room. The second bell just rang and students are supposed to be in their classrooms by now. Tomasz is sitting next to me. He missed the exam on Tuesday too; he had an orthodontist appointment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a very high drop to the first floor if either of us were to fall off the top of the lockers. The ledge is built a little higher than waist-level, so it’s only natural for students to use it as an adrenaline-inducing seat—any accidental horseplay could result in a 20-foot fall to the orange tiles below. Tomasz and I lean backwards over the edge, and look up through the skylight above our heads. It’s a grey day; it’s not ominously grey, but grey from cloud cover and a light rain. It’ll be a good day to walk around outdoors at lunch, I think to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sorry I’m late.” We both jerk our heads to the left. Our English teacher, Ms. Winters, is walking towards us carrying some papers. “I had to photocopy the test for you guys.” Tomasz and I sit up on the ledge. Ms. Winters unlocks the classroom door and flicks the lights on. Tomasz and I jump down from off the lockers and follow her into the class. We’re sat at separate tables and handed the exam. It’s only four pages, she tells us it shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes. We start the test. It’s as easy as I expected, “Give the definition of the following literary terms, and give an example.” Metaphor, simile, personification; they are the same terms we’ve studied since Grade 8. “I’ll be right back. No talking!” Ms. Winters tells us. She leaves the room in silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomasz and I sit busied, competing against one another to finish first. The sound of my rough tip pencil scratching the paper is all I hear. And then Tomasz farts. I chuckle a little, but I quickly realize that the smell is quite pungent, and I break into a full-on laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m lying on my back. There’s a really uncomfortable tube stuck in to the tip of my penis. I try to pull it out, but I can’t move my arms. My legs won’t move either. My mouth is dry. My eyes can’t focus on anything. I feel as though I’ve just woken up from a bad sleep, but that can’t be; last I remember, I was laughing at Tomasz’s fart. How could I have fallen asleep so suddenly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is my girlfriend’s dad watching me sleep? It’s unexpected, but it’s not unusual, is it? We talk about the Vancouver Canucks for a couple minutes. It might be longer than that, but it doesn’t feel like it. They lost to St. Louis last night. Todd Bertuzzi scored. And I’m back asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m lying on my back still. The tube is no longer in my penis; I remember that sensation coming out sometime overnight, I must’ve been half asleep. My arms and legs can move now. My mouth is still dry. I open my eyes to the morning light. I’m lying in bed, but it’s not my own. My dad is sitting in a large chair to my right. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What’s going on?” I ask him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You’re in the hospital.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m 16, I’ve gotten over the hilarity of somebody farting. But when the fart not only breaks the silence in a room, but also immediately dissipates its rotten egg stench throughout the small class, it’s pretty funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s the last thing I remember before I fell back in my chair and began convulsing on the classroom floor. There was no sensation of lightheadedness or dizziness, but it was immediate and I completely blacked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I’m told, after I wake up lucid next to my dad in the hospital, Tomasz saved my life. I bit my tongue and there was blood dripping from my mouth. The flaccid tongue had also fallen to the back of my mouth, restricting my breathing. As I lay on the floor, mid-seizure, Tomasz used my pencil to flip my tongue back to its resting place and he ran to an adjacent classroom to get help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I convulsed on the floor for about a minute, but I remained blacked out until a long time after I stopped shaking. Paramedics and firefighters were at my side within minutes, and I struggled violently to keep them off of me. It took six grown men to keep me down; I punched my vice-principal in the mouth in the process. I don’t remember any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was rushed to Surrey Memorial Hospital, where I was tethered to a bed and injected with a sleep-inducing drug every two minutes. The drugs slowly weaned me out of my unusually combative state, until I was nearly comatose. Nobody knew what was wrong with me, so they treated me for a variety of things: meningitis, encephalitis and West Nile Virus. I don’t remember any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the night at Surrey Memorial, waking up sporadically, still tethered down, and I would begin to cry and scream and struggle. My mom spent the night at my side. I woke up twice during the night and asked her, “What’s going on?” Both times she told me that I was in the hospital because I had a seizure at school. I cried myself to sleep both times. I don’t remember any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I was moved to B.C. Children’s Hospital in an ambulance. During the ride I was able to undo one of the straps tethering my arm. I was scared and violent. I cried myself to sleep. And again, I don’t remember any of this.&lt;br /&gt;I spent the afternoon getting tests done: spinal tap, EEG, CAT scan. I woke up two more times to my parents by my side, and they again, twice explained to me what was going on. And I cried myself to sleep for the last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up late that evening asking specifically to speak with George, my girlfriend’s dad, about the Canucks. This is my first memory after spending almost 36 hours in a drug-induced coma. My brain cannot tie together how I missed 36 hours of my life; how I went from being in class, laughing at a fart, to lying in bed the following night, barely conscious to talk about hockey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That following morning, Saturday, my dad explains everything that happened after I become fully lucid for the first time in 48 hours. Nurses immediately rush to my side, asking me if there was anything I needed and if I was uncomfortable. I’m no longer tied down to my bed, but I’m hooked up to an IV and I’m not allowed to get up. I’m alright with that because I’m awake, attentive and calm for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend the day with visitors in my room. Friends, family and classmates spend their Saturday filing in and out of my room, handing me gifts, and cards and posters. My parents tape them to the wall; a large banner signed by all my closest friends reading, “Get Well Soon Kyle” is taped to the bathroom door right in front of me. I’m overwhelmed by the flood of support and visitors that I kick them out early this evening, for a good night’s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday is a little quieter. Close friends come and visit, but now that I’ve been awake for a day their concerns for my health can fortunately subside a little. I think a lot today about the people who visit. The faces I’ve seen over the past two days do not surprise me. There are a couple classmates that I’d classify as “less than acquaintances” who have visited a handful of times, including while I was comatose at Surrey Memorial, but I quickly realize just how many people care. I have dozens of cards piled up on the bedside table next to me signed by classmates, teachers, friends, family members, even family friends that I haven’t seen in half a dozen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what people say about hospitals, that they’re dull, depressing places where people go to die, I respectfully disagree. I sit in my hospital bed overjoyed by the love and support that has flooded through the door. It not only makes me put my life in perspective, but the relationships I hold with the people that are nearest to my heart. It’s humbling to have to sit in a hospital bed, while loved ones come to see you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Sunday evening, test results are still inconclusive. The spinal tap was misplaced, so I was wheeled in to an operating room and had to have another, this time being completely lucid. My back was frozen so there wasn’t a lot of pain, but there was severe discomfort when the thick needle pierced through the flesh of my lower back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother brings some math homework to the hospital for me to do, but I have no interest in it. He tells me what it was like being at school on Friday; the whispering, the rumours. I had, according to rumours, done lines of cocaine before my English test and overdosed. Others said I spent the morning in the school’s Smoke Pit, smoking weed laced with something potent. None of the above was true, but it’s interesting to see how quickly rumours start and spread. It’s very well known among my classmates that I have never done drugs in my life, so the absurdity of the rumours that my seizure was somehow drug-related should’ve made them completely unreliable. But they both spread fast through the halls, and my brother spent his Friday defending my actions and reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he goes home that evening, I learn from my parents that my twin brother, of all the people in my family, took my hospitalization the hardest. He couldn’t bear to see me in my combative state, he got almost no sleep between Thursday and Saturday, and he spent most of his waking hours preoccupying himself by washing the walls in my house and obsessively cooking desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the last couple days, I have had the taste buds of a pregnant woman. Waking up every morning with unusual cravings: hash browns, cottage cheese and McDonalds pickles. I would get the food in front of me, and I wouldn’t eat it. I nibbled at the flakes of hash brown, I nibbled at a few curds of cottage cheese, and I ate less than one McDonalds pickle slice. I would crave the taste of food, but not once was I actually hungry. My stomach wasn’t grumbling; my body wasn’t telling me that I needed to eat, just taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday, my friends are all back in school so I spend the day with my parents and some family members who come to visit. My mom and dad are frequently pestering the doctors, asking when I’ll be able to go home. They tell us that I can’t be released until they know what’s wrong, or at least what isn’t wrong. My parents request that they move me back to Surrey Memorial: it’s closer to home and I’m above age to be admitted at B.C. Children’s, my parents feel that I don’t need to be here anymore. I completely agree. I see the odd child walking down the hallway outside my room, and it is painful to see them hooked up to machines. They don’t deserve to be in the hospital. They’re children. But they need to be here to get better, and I feel guilty that I’m taking a bed from a child who likely needs it more than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ambulance ride back to Surrey is very different. When I was young, my dad would play a game with my brothers and I where he would name cross streets in the Lower Mainland, and we would have to tell him what landmark or business is on the corner. I know my way around Vancouver very well, but when I’m on my back in a stretcher, and I can’t see outside, it makes for a very long drive. I can’t orient myself solely on the movement of the ambulance: the left turns, right turns, stops. It takes an eternity to get to Surrey Memorial, but the ambulance attendant and I talk about school, my future career plans and the Canucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday is Remembrance Day. I have nothing against the holiday, except I quickly learn that the lab conducting my spinal tap tests is closed for the day, which means the earliest I can be released is tomorrow. At least schools are closed today too, so I’m surrounded by friends. They eat my pickles and cottage cheese. They huddle at the foot of my bed and we watch Richie Rich. Today they tell me all about how they heard about my seizure: most were in class, when either Tomasz or one of the administrators came rushing in to grab them. They tell me of the tears amongst my friends and the jam-packed cars that followed the ambulances up to the hospital from the school. They tell me how long 48 hours feels when a close friend is comatose. They tell me how scared they all were for me. It’s very humbling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fall asleep watching The Mask, but I have a terrible sleep. My IV must be on extra-strength because I walk to the bathroom four times before morning. It’s the worst sleep I’ve had, that I remember, since being hospitalized. The nurses don’t wake me up to do tests anymore. They, the doctors, my parents and myself, are all convinced that the seizure was a freak occurrence and I should be cleared to go home today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The afternoon is spent watching movies. My parents come and go throughout the afternoon, but they have some errands to run, which doesn’t bother me. I slowly make my way through Back to the Future, frequently pausing for a doctor or nurse coming in to have a talk, or a family member showing up, or having to get up and walk to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My left hand is scarred and bruised from four different IV needle holes. The latest one, the one that the needle is still in, is widening with every venture to the bathroom. The toilet is only five steps from my bed, but there are cords blocking the IV from moving and the tube to my hand isn’t very long. So I pee with the door open and one arm outstretched back into my room, or else the needle begins to rip open my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Late Wednesday evening, the doctor comes in and tells my parents and I that I am being released from the hospital. I get an immediate and overwhelming feeling of gratitude. The IV is removed from my hand and I’m able to stray more than a few paces from my bed for the first time in a week. The last thing I do before leaving Surrey Memorial, pushed out in a wheelchair by my brother, is I weigh myself on the hospital scale. I lost 19 pounds in just under a week. I look weak and very pale, like I’ve been in the hospital for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night back in my own bed is very comforting. My mom even comes in to tuck me in for the first time since I was four years old. Despite my poor sleep the night before and my exhausting ordeal, I can’t sleep. I toss and turn in the sheets and my mind wanders. I think back to the wish I made five months earlier, when I lay in bed as I do right now, and I asked God to let me experience hospital life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize then that apart from a bit of pain and awkward sensations, I didn’t mind being in the hospital. I never had to witness the fears that my friends and families did. I fortunately didn’t have to be the one who sat in the waiting room for 48 hours, waiting for me to wake up coherent. I didn’t have to be the one to get relayed the news that a friend had been hospitalized for having a seizure and blacking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lay in bed thinking back on the week, realizing just how lucky I am. Not only for the fact that I was the only person who wasn’t awake to have to suffer during those 48 hours, but because there were so many people in my life who suffered during that time. There are so many people in my life who really care about me. It’s the most honest and humbling thoughts I’ve had in the entire ordeal, and it makes me cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, I lay in bed restless, and I ask God to help me fall asleep. And for the last time that week, for the only time I remember, and the only time I want to remember, I cry myself to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Well friends, this narrative took me a while to spin out. I feel like it is very incomplete still...this is the first time that I have attempted to tell this story, and I feel that there are truths and things that need to be revealed that are not yet evident in the text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to write the story, especially the beginning, from a very naive, almost child-like perspective...please let me know if this comes across!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>The youthful p.o.v. really comes across in the story. Particularly at the beginning like you mentioned. I could vividly see myself at the back of the class as a kid too! The only thing I would say you should do is to add more in the transition between meeting her and going to her place. The air of comfort seems to come in too suddenly. But then again, it might just be that I take a while to warm up to people. I noticed a great use of active, original verbs. I also loved your use of the word 'helter-skelter' as I am Beatles crazy. My favorite part was the ending where you were standing in front of her apartment. You had a very strong and effective conclusion that leaves a resounding impression on the reader. Amazing writing Gillian! </MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;I am Beatles-crazy too. And yes, frizzled is an amazing word :)&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

&lt;p&gt;i'm not satisfied with it, but i tried to do something different, and more &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; than i usually do, but turns out it was harder than expected...&lt;/p&gt;

                <MESSAGE> I keep hitting walls and walls and walls. This feels fragmented to me, but I suppose that is appropriate, because I feel fragmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may have been too early to tackle this, but anything else felt too unimportant. I'm not satisfied with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops. Edited to add that, thought I am not satisfied with this one, my Comp 1 was the one I came here to write, so in the end, I am still very much satisfied (if you read my Comp 3, in all its fragmentation, you will, I hope, understand why).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>After reading your last story, I was happy to read a little bit of continuation about Chet...I'm glad that he still keeps showing up in your stories. I also liked the fragmentation of the story...the little bits and pieces were interesting. It was very multi-faceted. The ending was nice as well - it resonated. A nice conclusion to the semester, I'd say.</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;An Unexpected Turn&lt;br /&gt;==================&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five years old, I was a carefree, spirited young girl.  Life was amazing, except for the fact that my twin brothers had just been born six months earlier and all my parent’s attention was no longer solely focused on me.  All those two munchkins seem to do is eat, poop, scream, and cry.  I try to help mom out as much as I can, and to be honest, I don’t mind being the big sister.  Eventually, when they begin to talk, I can boss them around and they have to listen to me because I am their older sister.  As I mentioned before, life is good, and my biggest problem is that I am not getting 100% of my parent’s attention.  Little do I know that in the blink of an eye my life is to be turned upside down.  My problem will be of no comparison to the attention problem that I am suffering now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is March 12, 1993, and I can remember as if it happened yesterday.  I wake up like I do everyday to the sound of my little brothers screaming for attention in their cribs.  When I finally manage to open my eyes and walk downstairs, mom has already gotten them from their mahogany stained cribs, decorated with blue comforters set in a room full of hockey memorabilia.  It is quite obvious that my dad has big dreams for his little boys.  My room on the other hand looks like that of a princess.  Pink is the dominant colour, and I don’t believe there is any lace or ruffles left in the world after my mom was finished decorating my room.  As I step into the kitchen, my brothers are sitting up in their highchairs, a task that they only learnt a little while ago and apparently it was a big deal to mom and dad.  I, on the other hand, could care less, I sit up in my seat everyday and nobody pays any attention to that or gives me praise.  Dad is already at work so I proceed to help mom feed one of my brothers, because I know that I will not be getting my breakfast until their stomachs are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once breakfast is finished, mom announces that we will be heading to the park.  Fortunately, it is a Tuesday and on Tuesdays I don’t have school.  I walk into my cotton candy coloured room and pick out some grubby jeans and one of my “play t-shirts” because I know if I walk downstairs wearing one of my new outfits, mom will send me right back up to my room.  Even though I’m a five-year old girl who is the epitome of a princess, when it comes to playing in the park, I like to get down and dirty with the other boys.  Unfortunately, my clothes suffer.  Although I don’t like wearing my old clothes, and would much rather be dressed up in my pink skirt and my matching flowered top, I know that it won’t go over too well with mom.  Grudgingly, I get dressed and make my way downstairs.  Mom already has the boys bundled up and strapped in their two-seater stroller.   I don’t think it is fair that they don’t have to walk and they can get pushed around everywhere.  In mentioning my jealousy to mom, she explains that if I want to be the big sister with big sister privileges, then I will walk to the park without complaining.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk though the cul-de-sac and around the corner, I look up at mom and notice that her normal glow is gone and that her usual smile is almost a frown.  Concerned, as there are very few times in life when I remember my mom wearing a frown, I ask her what’s wrong.  Before she can get the words out of her mouth, I see a tear fall down her face.  Now I’m scared!  It is a well known fact amongst five-year olds that parents do not cry.  Children are allowed to cry, when they are sick or fall down or a sibling steals their toy away, but parents, on the other hand, do not cry.  I am very worried, as I see that tear being followed by more tears.  I don’t know what to do and my first instinct is to imitate my mom when I’m crying, so I grab her around her waist, as I can’t reach much higher, and I give her the biggest hug that my skinny fifty pound body can muster.  However, this does not seem to help, as her tears have now turned into sobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My five year old brain begins to rack through my mental memory trying to think of what I have done to make her so unhappy.  I stole a cookie when she was not looking before dinner yesterday, but there’s no way she could have found that out and the boys did throw some of their breakfast on the floor at breakfast this morning, but they do that all the time and there’s never been any tears.  I am scared to say or do anything, for fear that I will make her feel worse.  Before I know it I’m in tears too, because if mom is sad that there must be reason for me to be sad. I did not realize until I dried my eyes that we are not going to the park anymore, but mom had turned the stroller around and we are heading back into our cul-de-sac.  I am upset because I wanted to go to the park, because Damion and I were going to have a rematch at Cops and Robbers, a game that I had made up.  However, I know that something must be wrong with mom and my rematch with Damion can wait for another day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walk back into the house, I can see that mom has regained her composure and she tells me to go play with my Barbies, while she puts the boys down for their nap.  Still confused by the mornings events, I walk into my room and take out my Barbie dream house.  Dad had bought it for me for my fifth birthday.  I had been asking for it everyday since I had first seen the commercial on television.  I was so exhilarated when saw it on my birthday with a big pink bow on top.  After five minutes of pretending that Ken and Barbie are fighting over where to go on their next vacation, either Disneyland or Disneyworld, my mom walks into my room and sits on my canopy bed.  She asks me to sit next to her.  I leave my Barbies in their dream house and crawl up on the bed.  She looks at me with her loving soft blue eyes and gives me the kind of hugs that only parents are capable of giving.  The ones that make you feel safe, loved, and like there is nothing wrong in the world.  Her warm gaze turns to a more serious one.  She then explains to me some of the most life altering news I have ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explains to me that both dad and her love me very much and that they only want the best for me and my little brothers.  After asking if I understand this, I nod, still very confused as to what is going on.  She then proceeds to tell me that her and dad have been fighting a lot lately, and that it is not good when two people fight.  She says that when two people fight, sometimes they have to be separated, otherwise it is hard on the people around them.  She makes it clear, however, that they are not fighting because of me and my brothers, but over adult things, things that have nothing to do with us.  She asks me if I’m alright, and after hesitating for a moment, I say yes because I think that is what she wants to hear and all I want is for my mom to be happy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although at that point in my life, I did not quite understand what was going on, I knew from that day on that my life was different not only from the life that I was used to living previous to that day, but different from my friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no tears were shed at the time mom told me this terrible, life-shattering news, the following night was when the waterworks started.  As I climb into my bed and my mom sits lays beside me, her body snuggled next to mine, she reads me my favorite story, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  She kisses me on the forehead, tells me she leaves me, and it hits me so hard that I could literally feel my heart sink down into my chest; my dad is not next to her ready to give me a kiss.  Normally, while my mom was tucking me in, my dad was off trying to settle my brothers, which was always a chore.  After he was finished with them, he was always right behind mom waiting for his turn to say goodnight to me.  However, tonight he is not.  The tears start to flow.  I am trying with all my might to stop them, because I know that me crying is not going to help the situation and it is just going to make mom more upset that she already is.  But I can’t help it, I’m five, and all I want is for both my mom and my dad to hug me and kiss me good night.  Is that too much to ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days slowly drifted by and I began to get used to one parent tucking me into bed.  The hurt did not go away, but I learned to mask my pain for the benefit of both mom and dad.  Days turned into months, and soon Christmas was approaching, the biggest holiday celebrated in my family and the one that holds the most tradition.  However, tradition was gone from my household now and holidays, although still a happy time, were much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up Christmas morning sporting red and green striped Christmas pajamas that we always get to open on Christmas Eve right before we head off to bed.  They were the ugliest pajamas you have ever seen, but they were Christmas colours, and that is all that matters in my eyes.  I am excited to see what Santa has brought for me so I race downstairs, without even waking up my brothers or my mom.  I see that Santa has come up a little short this year with the presents, but I’m thrilled nonetheless.  Five minutes later, mom comes down with my brothers also sporting Christmas colours and we begin to open our presents.  Well, I begin to open my presents and help my brothers tear through their snowmen paper, as they’re not old enough to fully comprehend what is happening.  Although my mom attempts to keep things as normal as possible, there is a tangible void without dad there.  Mom now has to fill the role of taking pictures, using the video camera and making sure our pancake breakfast is ready by the time were finished opening all the gifts.  We then proceed to go to my grandma’s for turkey dinner with all the fixings.  The next day my brothers and I do Christmas all over again at my dads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through elementary school, my friends were always jealous because I got two Christmases and two birthdays, which meant double the presents.  I played it up and acted like I quite enjoyed the double presents, but deep down I was jealous of them.  Maybe they didn’t as many gifts to open Christmas morning, but they had their mom and their dad living in one house.  They had a mom and dad who tucked them in at night.  I would have gladly given up my two Christmases for my dad to be with me that Christmas morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment those fatal words came out of my mom’s mouth, I didn’t know the implications of what my mom was telling me.  I didn’t know that my parents separating meant that my dad would not live with me anymore.  I didn’t know that my parents separating meant that I only got to see my dad two days of the week.  I didn’t know that my parents separating meant that one day both of them would find another husband or wife that they would love and I would have to live with.  And above all, I didn’t understand why they had to separate.  I don’t remember them fighting, either verbally or physically, and I certainly don’t remember either of them being unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day I don’t fully understand the reason that they got a divorce.  I was too young to comprehend what was going on and I am too scared now to ask any questions.  Once in a while they’ll share their side of the story.  However, I never get the whole story and their stories don’t always match up.  Who do I believe, who do I blame?  These are questions that I deal with daily.  Fifteen years later and that day still haunts me.  In life, I try to find the positive in everything.  The only positive I can take from this situation is a lesson learned for my own life.  As much as marriage is not a life commitment in today’s society, I want to make sure that it is in my own life.  The person that I settle down with and say my vows to, will be the person I spend my whole life with.  Till death do us part are words that I do not take lightly.  Love is not merely a feeling, it is a choice, a choice that we must make every day when we wake up, even when it seems like a hard one to make.  When things are not going perfect, or everything about your significant other drives you crazy, that commitment has to stay strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

                <MESSAGE>&lt;p&gt;Chantelle, your story was very interesting...you particularly caught my attention because I am the oldest daughter in my family too, and I have younger twin brothers as well (although they are only two years younger than me). I understand how you felt as a little girl when no one seems to pay attention to you anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your narrative was really interesting as well, and I am sorry for your loss. It sounds like a lot for a small child to deal with. I find that even just writing about difficult situations can sometimes bring a new clarity to the past. I admire your bravery in sharing this story.&lt;/p&gt;</MESSAGE>

        <ALLTEXT>
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Creative Writing 3130, a course in the creativity and craft of non-fiction writing. This course is designed to offer you the opportunity to explore your writing in a focused and collaborative environment, to assist you in honing the quality of your work, and to invite you to participate in the joys (and challenges) of the art of writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basic Philosophy of the Course &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative writing is a powerful, ancient, and yet delicate practice. We write -- quietly, often in isolation, in tentative and mercurial moods. (Quick tip: an em-dash is often more effective than a colon when used before a short list, as in the sentence above.) We revise, and turn back upon our own narratives, and wonder about the reception our work might meet in the world. Sometimes we hide manuscripts in drawers, or take deliberate action -- as did Franz Kafka and Mahatma Gandhi -- to prevent our words from making their way to an audience. Kafka and Gandhi were both unsuccessful in preventing their writings from being destroyed; but their impulse to do so, to keep hooded the hawk of their creativity, is common among writers of all stripes. We're not sure that we have, really, anything to say; or we are afraid that if our words are not well met we might ourselves be wounded. Or we believe, as did the ancient Egyptians, that words have their own life, for good or for ill, and that writing is a means of seizing the power of the gods. This course attempts to explore this conversation -- between the writer and the wider world -- and to find ways of bringing our writing safely out of hiding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be exploring craft, and method, and the strategic practices every writer must learn in wrestling with narrative. Each of us will examine our strengths -- the ways in which the natural mood and flavour of our writing makes itself known -- and our vulnerabilities as well: how we get stuck, or lazy, how we lost confidence and gain doubt. How we learn to shut down and hope the whole thing will go away. (Quick craft tip: a sentence does not always require a traditional subject-verb structure. Sometimes, as in the sentence above, setting off a dependent clause as its own sentence is an effective method of punctuating the thought.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is about writing, and reading, and making a claim for our fundamental right to use words on paper. Within that context, we will explore the ethics of writing (particularly about one's own family or culture of history), the hurdles of writing (as they involve craft and precision and clarity) and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that is to say, the long tradition of writers of creative non-fiction). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threshold between fact and fiction (which is not the same as that between truth and lie) is the territory of creative non-fiction. In this course we stake out that territory, inspecting the geology of its forms and ideals, finding our own individual places to homestead. Creative non-fiction involves the search for truth, and fidelity to fact, yet also an awareness that truth and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do about it. And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the foundation of all the arts and sciences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art, craft, power, purpose: writing is all these things, and many others too. In this course we will make connections between the various threads of creative writing, forge those connections in our own work, and share that work with one another. (Quick craft tip: &amp;quot;each other&amp;quot; is best used when two people or items are involved; &amp;quot;one another&amp;quot; is best used when there are more than two.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approaches and Practices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course involves three basic activities: reading, writing, and sharing. (Quick craft tip: it has become common practice to omit the final comma in a list, but this is not a rule. One method of determining what will work best is to read the sentence aloud. If the comma serves the spoken rhythm of the sentence, leave it in; if not, take it out.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Readings &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the course readings posted here, please read at least three of the books on the &lt;a href=&quot;$@RESOURCEVIEWBYID*86178@$&quot; title=&quot;booklist&quot;&gt;book list&lt;/a&gt;. One method of approaching the literature for this course is to read for craft and for pleasure. Look for the strategies and methods of the various authors we'll be reading: how they construct narratives, how they use tricks and tools, how they carry the reader along with a skill that seems effortless. These are artifacts of craft. And, in addition to these, remember to enjoy what you are reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three writing assignments are required for this course: a memoir, a literary travelogue, and a personal essay. These genres overlap, so it may be simpler to think of the assignments as three projects of creative non-fiction on subjects of your choosing. The assignments are relatively brief in terms of length, and are intended to provoke your creativity and your thought, to encourage you to start thinking in terms of writing as a craft as opposed to simply a means of ejecting your thoughts onto paper. (This last comment is a jibe against a mode of writing much in vogue today: spontaneous writing, in which we are encouraged to write without thought, splashing words onto the page, in haste, in full emotional flight, saving editing and precision for a later, more sober frame on mind. As we will discuss in the class, I am not a fan of this style of composition. Among other liabilities, it wastes a great deal of effort and time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For philosophical reasons, I do not prescribe a particular length for the projects: a great essay can be a few pages long (as we'll see). Yet it is difficult to craft a non-fiction essay in less than a few thousand words. So, if you prefer a guideline for the length of the projects, I offer two recommendations: make them as long as they need to be; make them somewhere between two and five thousand words. There is no upper limit on the length of the projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;I'm not interested in how much you can write but rather in the quality of your writing. Perhaps you write like Hemingway, perhaps like Melville or Tolstoy. I don't know, and maybe you don't know either. But I can tell you this: writing a shorter piece of great precision is more difficult than writing a longer, more relaxed and wandering work. In the context of smaller projects every word is on display and under scrutiny, whereas in longer works the sheer bulk of the material tends to hide various flaws. Melville, in fact, is a good example of this.
&lt;p&gt;You may write short narratives in this course, but please do not write short form as a means of avoiding work. You will know, I will notice, and neither of us will be happy. Instead, make your work as long as it needs to be. If you compose a lovely, resonant, short piece, you will receive an excellent evaluation. But as I said, writing shorter pieces is actually more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With reference to good, short pieces, I suggest (strongly) looking at the work of W.S. Merwin. Some of his material is in your reader. But look at his poetry too, his lovely un-punctuated poetry in which the bare words embody some strange and familiar light. Here's an example of what I mean: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why did he promise me&lt;br /&gt; that we would build ourselves&lt;br /&gt; an ark all by ourselves&lt;br /&gt; out in back of the house&lt;br /&gt; on New York Avenue&lt;br /&gt; in Union City New Jersey&lt;br /&gt; to the singing of the streetcars&lt;br /&gt; after the story&lt;br /&gt; of Noah whom nobody&lt;br /&gt; believed about the waters&lt;br /&gt; that would rise over everything&lt;br /&gt; when I told my father&lt;br /&gt; I wanted us to build&lt;br /&gt; an ark of our own there&lt;br /&gt; in the back yard under&lt;br /&gt; the kitchen could we do that&lt;br /&gt; he told me that we could&lt;br /&gt; I want to I said and will we&lt;br /&gt; he promised me that we would&lt;br /&gt; why did he promise that&lt;br /&gt; I wanted us to start then&lt;br /&gt; nobody will believe us&lt;br /&gt; I said that we are building&lt;br /&gt; an ark because the rains&lt;br /&gt; are coming and that was true&lt;br /&gt; nobody ever believed&lt;br /&gt; we would build an ark there&lt;br /&gt; nobody would believe&lt;br /&gt; that the waters were coming&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Repeat: we are not creating such a group. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not have fun in this course, something will have gone seriously wrong. Fun and creativity are aspects of the same process. If you get stuck, or are uncertain, of find that your energy dwindles, let me know. Let's figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmr-9&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;First of all, becoming a writer is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmr-9&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;mainly a matter of cultivating a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmr-9&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;writer’s temperament. &lt;/span&gt;(Dorothea Brande)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionHead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;titlemark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt; A Writer’s Temperament&lt;/span&gt;… &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;!--l. 72--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Writers learn their art in large part by reading the works of others; absorbing it, distilling it, rendering it down until it coalesces into a new and personal style. A writer writes, yes, but first a writer reads. &lt;!--l. 74--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Choose three books from the list: one within the genre of your own work, one in an unfamiliar genre or subject, and one for enjoyment. In other words, choose for resonance, craft, and fun.&lt;!--l. 76--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; So, to sum up: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;1. Read three books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;2. Read everything on this moodle site. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;3. Read some more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4. Keep reading. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5. Don't stop reading. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6. Remember to read. &lt;br /&gt;

        <SUMMARY> Text only, please. And don't write directly into the forum! &lt;br /&gt;</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>
&lt;h3&gt;What to Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal: word processors are evil. Stop using them. Instead, as we will discuss, plain text and its derivatives are unequivocally the best means of getting your word into a computer or onto the web. Plain text is what we will use in this course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my one and only firm rule: no Word files. Most of the material for the course will be posted in the forums, so this obviates the need for Word anyway, but for the final project: no Word files. Plain text only, please, in one of the following formats: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plain text &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reStructured text &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DocBook &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;xml &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Document text (a version of xml) &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LaTeX &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PDF LaTeX &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Look at that plethora of choices! &lt;br /&gt; But not, you will notice, Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never heard of, let alone worked with, any of these formats, don't worry about it. You just need one: plain text. We'll talk about how to make that work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here's what Microsoft says about the suitability of Word for writers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;There is no word processor, including Word, that's perfectly suitable for professional writers [since they] represent only a small portion of the overall market for word processors.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Not to Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save yourself the grief: don't write directly into the forum. The web is a mercurial universe; sometimes it will take your carefully-crafted words and decide to shut you down (especially if you use Internet Explorer). Your browser will crash, your net connection will fry, your router will choke. Something will happen -- often enough that it will feel like karma for all those bad things you did as a child -- and you will lose work. Be warned. The gods of creativity are watching. They want you to write in a text editor, to save obsessively (by reflexively typing the Save sequence every time you finish a sentence), and to copy and paste into the forum. This will please them.&lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY> The essentials.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT> This is a basic formatting guide to composing documents in plain text. Do not use a word processor. Instead, use a text editor: Notepad, BBEdit, cream, vim, emacs, xemacs, Homesite, Notepad2, TextPad, Writeboard, Darkroom, etc. Many of these are free or almost-free. Look &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;text editors&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a list of options. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your file with a txt extension. Plain text files offer the most flexibility, portability, and faithfulness to the creative process. In this course, we will be using the basic formatting methods of reStructuredText, a system that allows one source document (the txt file) to be converted to many different formats (for the web, for publishing, for handhelds, etc.). Here are some core reStructuredText strategies: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Paragraphs &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Separate paragraphs with one blank line (just hit the enter key once). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a paragraph. &lt;br /&gt;This is another paragraph. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Paragraphs must have the same indentation -- that is, line up at their left edge. Do not add tabs or spaces at the beginning of a paragraph unless it is an extended quotation. In that case, indent each line of the quoted paragraph with a single tab. Paragraphs that are indented in this way will result in indented paragraphs. For example: &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a regular paragraph. It's quite short. It has no indents or tabs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt; This paragraph will result in an indented block of text, typically used for quoting other text. A tab has been used at the beginning of each line (though, depending on your browser, this snippet may only be one line long). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Text Styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Inside paragraphs and other bodies of text, you may additionally mark text for &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;*italics*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot; or &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;**bold**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot;. However, be aware that using bold text is the surest sign of amateur writing and typography. Italics are used for titles of books and such, and may rarely be used for emphasis -- rarely. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3 style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;A Sample Document &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;Here is my title &lt;br /&gt;================ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I underline the title with a series of equals signs that add up to the same length as the words in the title. This is my first paragraph. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my second paragraph. I hit the enter key for each new paragraph. I do not indent or add spaces. I use two spaces and small dashes -- for an em dash. I don't worry about smart quotes but use regular keyboard quotes instead. Later, if I want to publish my document online, I can run it through any number of tools that will make all the quotes and dashes look proper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My document has a title and four paragraphs. It is a masterpiece. One of the things that makes it a masterpiece is that it is a plain text document, with a .txt extension. This means that it is highly portable and flexible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a *very* compelling narrative. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY> Evaluation</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>
&lt;p&gt;My primary focus, as an instructor, is to assist you in developing your creativity. Grades are quite far down on the list of priorities for me. I am focused on your engagement with the process, your commitment to your own work, the extent to which you show up, metaphorically, to be as present as you can be. These are evaluation criteria for me (see the course outline for more on evaluation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own criteria will be blended with the evaluation guidelines from the creative writing program, which are directed more toward craft and articulated below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A+ 90-100%, A 85-89%, A- 80-84% &lt;br /&gt;Excellent: the use of language is pleasing and vigorous. The writing invites reading; the work is well-crafted and grammatically flawless. The author is perceptive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;B+ 76-79% &lt;br /&gt;Very good: the use of language is generally correct. There may be a need for further editing. This could be in the presentation of the work (style, voice, characterisation, plot, point of view), or in the language (diction, grammar, usage, spelling, punctuation)-- but the writing is involving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;B 72-75% &lt;br /&gt;Good: the author has created a manuscript with substantial content and without any serious errors in tone or narration. Problems with creative shaping and delivery may occur, and there may be a further need for learning the mechanics of language use, but generally, the problems do not interfere with the reader’s appreciation of the work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;B- 68-71% &lt;br /&gt;Manuscripts with repeated errors in grammar, usage or punctuation will result in a grade of no higher than B- regardless of the proficiency and imagination demonstrated in the creative aspects of the work. &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, manuscripts with no problems in grammar, usage or punctuation may not receive a grade higher than B- if they fail to demonstrate an understanding of the challenges (of style or voice, for example) involved in writing in the genre. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;C+ 64-67% &lt;br /&gt;Satisfactory: this writing shows constrained use of language (either in the creative shaping and delivery of content or in repeated errors in grammar punctuation, diction and usage), and the treatment of the material has not resulted in sufficient depth. The writing is potentially interesting, and a revision may improve the manuscript. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;C 60-63% &lt;br /&gt;This meets the minimum criteria of the assignment without in any way exceeding it. There are repeated errors such as spelling mistakes, sloppiness or a lack of depth to the writing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;C- 56-59% Below average: the writing is difficult to read because of inappropriate delivery or repeated grammatical errors or both. Furthermore, the idea may not be appropriate for the form. This grade does not permit students to pursue another course for which the graded course was a pre-requisite. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;D/F 50-55% Fail: the author fails to understand the nature of creative writing or has not tried. &lt;br /&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY> What goes first on four legs, then on two legs, then on three?</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT> &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;What goes first on four legs, then on two legs, then on three?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The oldest artifacts of human endeavor — cave paintings at Lascaux and Altamira, tools in the Blombos caves, Venus figurines so fantastically old we hardly recognize ourselves — are works of art. Creativity is the imprint of humanity, from the outline of a hand painted with ochre on a cave wall, to the mandalas and sacred paintings of the medieval traditions, to the films and music and poetry of today. Throughout all of human history, creativity has been the means by which we understand the inner and the outer worlds, the crucible in which we store our collected wisdom and our fears. The function of all creative traditions — the arts and the sciences, religion and philosophy, politics and war — is to explore the extent to which we can know ourselves. &lt;!--l. 48--&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; In that exploration, which is fraught with conflicts and dead-ends and transformations, we’re always coming back to one question: it’s an old one, old even to the Greeks from whom Freud borrowed it, already old when the Egyptians fashioned a great monument to symbolize it. It is perhaps the oldest riddle of humanity, certainly the favorite riddle of psychology, and it is this: “What goes first on four legs, then on two legs, then on three?” The simple answer, widely known, is human beings (first we crawl on four legs, then we walk on two, then we use a cane — three legs — in old age). But this riddle, asked by a magical animal that is part hunting lion, part thinking woman, is actually about the contradictions of human experience. The sphinx asks about the essence hidden within our diversities; it’s question is about the soul. And creativity, more than any other endeavor, is the study of the soul. &lt;!--l. 50--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; These days we have new ways of asking the riddle of the sphinx, and in our drive to be more scientific and medical, our responses to the riddle have become more complex; but they are no more precise. The answer, after all, is unfathomable. We’re still putting our hands up to the cave wall and inscribing around them with ochre. Only now, our tools are slightly different: computers, research modalities, theories. Our approaches to the riddle are possibly more robust than those of our ancestors, but they are probably more fragile as well. What has not changed, in a hundred thousand years of human psychology, is the fundamental creative impulse to understand ourselves and our world. &lt;!--l. 52--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; This is why we possess myths and stories, why we cherish works of art, why many people return (often grudgingly, as though creative approaches diminish us) to the holistic and creative modalities that have proved reliable for millennia. We like the new, we like to demonstrate that we’re making progress, that we’ve discovered fresh and important truths. And possibly we have. But one of the truths we continue to rediscover is that human nature is consistent, for good and for ill, and that it sometimes requires the simple symbols and stories embedded within its history. The creativity of those stories connects us to something inside ourselves that is strong and strange and elemental; a kind of empowerment, to use a term from modern psychology. This empowerment, which extends beyond the individual, is the reason for the Taliban banning music. It’s the reason that the cellist Vedran Smilovic played in the street during the war in Sarajevo, while snipers fired upon him. It’s the reason that many of us return, again and again, to the stories and images that comprise our identity. When nothing else is left, when the world’s ruthlessness has stripped us of our carefully constructed modernism or intellectualism or rationalism, it’s often to creativity that we turn for our deepest solace. &lt;!--l. 54--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Perhaps the ancients were right: the arts and sciences beckon the gods, beseech them to intervene in the struggle between humanity and its own nature. Now, as always, that struggle preoccupies us: in Iraq, in Liberia, in Israel; and in our jobs, along the streets of our neighborhoods, in our minds as we lie awake late into the night. We used to tell stories in the night, around fires and under the stars that travelers at sea looked to for direction. We used to find order there, and constancy, and a sense of harmony beyond the world’s duress. We no longer tell those kinds of stories, and we can’t return to a belief in them. Now we find order in the genome, constancy in biochemistry. These are new stories, crafted carefully. &lt;!--l. 56--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; But sometimes the new stories are insufficient to the task of making sense of a world that is routinely nonsensical. Our genome and our biochemistry do not explain why we continue to war against each other, or why we struggle with poverty and environmental degradation. It’s easy, as a citizen of such a world, to become cynical, or to feel helpless, or desperate. Most of us can no longer believe in the old gods, and the new ones seem indifferent. &lt;!--l. 58--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Creativity is perhaps the only means of resolving this conundrum. Creativity forges a path where none exists. Right now, because people sense this, we’re seeing a tremendous resurgence in the creative spirit. This is the natural response to trauma and insecurity. We make new stories, we challenge the way things are, by means of visions of the way things could be. This is neither denial nor wishful thinking. It is the soul’s affirmation that our world is what we make it; that even as we limp along on three legs, tired and haggard and threadbare, something or someone comes to our aid. All the old tales speak of this. &lt;!--l. 60--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; There are many stories of the crossroads. Monsters and unexpected guides tend to show up there, as do talismans and visions and magic. The gates of the city where Oedipus faced the sphinx are at the crossroads. And the challenge of the crossroads is ever the same: to answer the sphinx’s riddle &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;who are we&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;!--l. 62--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The sphinx’s riddle is the essence of creative work. We stand at the crossroads, looking the beast in the eye, trying not to be the first one to blink. &lt;!--l. 64--&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; A great many people are at the crossroads these days, looking out at the horizon to see which way the road goes. Our society is at the crossroads, too: one of our paths, the one we’re now on, leads away from the creativity and toward determinism. On this road we study the mind but not the soul. The other road, which is indistinct, hazy, which seems not to run straight but instead wanders across the plain, is the soul’s road. It embodies our heritage, as storytellers and witnesses, and the promise of our continuance. Some of use are choosing to sit around the fire of stories, to speak and listen and dream, so that the night sounds from the forest don’t seem so baleful and lonely. It’s an archaic, simple, creative urge, easy to dismiss amid the complexities of today. But it’s how we answer the riddle. &lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

Depending upon which statistics you consult, somewhere between 20 and 50 per cent of university and college students will plagiarize at some point. This is bad news from an academic point of view, obviously; but the real cost is levied in terms of creative integrity. Plagiarism kills the creative spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <SUMMARY> Thoughts on the practicality of plain text.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>In this course there is typically much discussion about my suggested formatting strategies: plain text and its derivatives, xml, LaTeX, and so on. So, in light of this, I thought I'd provide a real-world example -- not a philosophical example, but an actual application of the philosophy.

Let's say you write a personal essay, using Word. You like the results of your work, and you want other people to read the essay. So you print out the manuscript and send it to a magazine publisher. They accept the submission and request that you send them a Word file. Good so far. You send a digital file to the publisher. In collaboration with you, they make a few changes. Also, during production, they copy-fit a few things and make more, smaller changes. These final changes are made not in Word but in Quark Express, the software the publisher uses for laying out the magazine. You agree with each of the changes, and you want the document on your computer to reflect the most current version, the Quark Express version. You can either go through the version of the manuscript on your computer, making the changes manually, or you can ask the publisher to export the Quark file into Word. This may or may not work properly, especially if your manuscript includes foreign or accented words. You may be required to input the changes on your copy by combing through the version in the magazine. This is workable, but not ideal.

Now, let's say that the publisher agrees that you may display the essay on your blog a few months after the magazine comes out. For this purpose you will use your Word file. You export the Word file to html, copy it to the text window of your blog, and hit the Submit button. Now, Word is notorious for messing up web pages, so it may happen (probably will happen) that various aspects of the formatting of your essay will be messed up (such as indents and accents, for example). But more troubling than this is the fact that Word has created a web page for you that violates all kinds of Internet standards. This means, practically speaking, that your document will look unprofessional and may, in fact, be almost unreadable, to a large proportion of the online community. If you are lucky, your blog has the handy &quot;clean up Word html&quot; option, but most blogs do not. Very likely you will end up with a poorly-formatted document, with odd symbols for accents and quotation marks, and you will have no idea how to fix this. You will have to comb through the online version of the document, making the changes manually.

Later, long after the magazine is issued and your blog has moved on to other scintillating topics, you want to archive the essay. So, you copy it to a CD. The reliability of the average CD is about ten years, but you figure that's long enough. You put the document on the CD and forget about it. But a few years later, after you have upgraded your computer and software, you decide that you want to retrieve the essay. If enough time has passed (say, about seven years) you will not be able to read the file. Your future word processor will use a different format. You may be able to use an archived version of Word, but it may not function on your current computer. You might, in fact, lose the document altogether. Or, if you have a printed copy somewhere, you may have to re-type the whole thing. As someone who has had to do this, I can confirm that it's not much fun.

So, here are the basic issues involved in the situation above: conflicting versions, cross-platform compatibility, and archiving. Here's how we'd solve this with plain text.

You compose the document in plain text. You provide the publisher with plain text. They send you an updated plain text or xml file with all the current changes. You use this file to create a valid html file from plain text (using one of the many tools for this). You post the document on your blog with perfect formatting and structure. (Maybe you're in a hurry, and you just copy and paste the plain text into the text editor window of your blog. This will also work perfectly.) You typeset and print the document using LaTeX, a plain text derivative. This provides you with a higher level of typesetting, by far, than is available in any word processor. (The text layout engine in Quark Express is based on LaTeX.) You archive the document on the web, which  offers a longer archive life than CD. Fifty years from now, you access the essay without any trouble at all.

At every step above, the plain text file is used as a base, and other formats -- for publishing, for the web, etc. -- are built upon the plain text structure. The plain text file therefore becomes the master document, and since all computer technologies are based on plain text codes (ASCII and utf-8 codes, to be precise), the document will not be made obsolete by changing technologies. It will remain accessible and flexible.

That's the basic idea. Plain text is not simply a philosphical choice. The only method of ensuring that you maintain maximal control of the content and functionality of your documents is to create and store them in plain text.

Content and presentation are separate functions, and should remain separate throughout the writing and editing process. Every intrustion of presentation into the writing process detracts from that process and encourages the accumulation of unnecessary formatting codes that prevent seamless transfer of the document to other formats and viewing methods. The web, which has embraced fully this separation, is an excellent example of why such a strategy is important: if the document is to made available to a diverse group of people using diverse technologies of access (computers of different vintages; PC, Mac, and Linux operating systems; different web browsers), the document must be flexible enough to accommodate these conflicting modes. The only way to accomplish this is to separate the content from the presentation, and allow the viewing technology -- the computers and browsers of individual viewers -- to assemble the document for each specific instance. If the presentation is embedded, this cannot happen. 

If you've ever tried to look at various web pages in different browsers, on different computers, you will know what I mean. Some pages look radically different with different viewing tools. These are pages in which the presentation is embedded. But other pages seem to thrive under diverse viewing conditions. These are pages in which the content and presentation have remained separate.

To paraphrase your favorite super-hero: &quot;Must... keep... content separate ... from presentation.&quot;

        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the list below. Observe how many authors use pen and paper as the primary medium of their creative process. Experiment with this in your own writing. As we progress in the course, try to write something by hand, using different types of pens and paper. Explore the shapes your handwriting wants to make. Find a style and a medium that suits you. (Personally, I recommend a Waterman fountain pen and Clairefontaine paper, both available from the &lt;a title=&quot;google map to pen shop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/maps?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&amp;amp;hs=X88&amp;amp;q=the+pen+shop&amp;amp;near=Vancouver,+BC&amp;amp;radius=0.0&amp;amp;latlng=49250494,-123111934,13845710018423370032&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&quot;&gt;Vancouver Pen Shop&lt;/a&gt;.) Later, you can transcribe (and edit) on the computer. But, as we will discuss, computers present their own hurdles in the creative writing process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try, at least once, to rid yourself of the distractions of modern technology. Remove the clumsy and inhibiting machine. Write straight to the page.

        <SUMMARY>Stop using a word processor!</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;In a recent workshop on the materials and tools of writing I asked the group to indicate which method they used to input text on a computer. Almost everyone used &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Microsoft Word &lt;/span&gt;— with the exception of a sole advocate for the &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;OpenOffice &lt;/span&gt;word processor (which is far better than &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/span&gt;, and which uses the open source &lt;span class=&quot;cmcsc-10&quot;&gt;XML &lt;/span&gt;file format). &lt;!--l. 304--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; But the trend — even among seasoned writers — seemed decidedly weighted toward mainstream word processors. This homogenization of word processing, whether on the Mac or PC, inevitably delivers a consistent — and therefore conformist — experience to the act of typing on screen. The method of input unquestionably influences the output. By way of subtle cues and imagery (icons, menus, procedures), word processors inculcate a particular type of consciousness. Works of writing from different authors but produced on the same word processor will be more similar than those produced using separate tools. The differences will be subtle but not inconsequential. &lt;!--l. 306--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Moreover, all word processors introduce a level of aesthetic abstraction that is&amp;nbsp; not useful to the writing process. Word processors encourage us to fiddle with fonts and spacing, with countless page layout options, with the visual aspect of work that in its initial stages should be primarily visceral. &lt;!--l. 308--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; And word processors are ergonomically inefficient. The mouse, which requires the full use of one arm, is a primary tool in word processors, as are menus and keystrokes assigned for mnemonic rather than ergonomic functions (control-S to save, for example, requires the removal of the left hand from the home row of the keyboard). Years ago, as I began to understand that my persistent arthritic aches were essentially caused by mouse and keyboard use, ergonomics became a core consideration. &lt;!--l. 310--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Another liability of word processors involves their proprietary file formats, which impede the export and transfer of information to open source formats, such as are found on the World Wide Web. If you want to publish on the Web, word processors make this extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, consider this: if you are writing in &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/span&gt;, Microsoft owns your material. After all, your text is in their file format, and if you want to view or edit that text you need to buy their software. Does this seem like an equitable or safe arrangement in terms of safeguarding your intellectual property? &lt;!--l. 312--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Now, to alternatives and solutions. Take a look at Bram Moolenaar’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Seven Habits of Effective Text Editing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Bram’s examples use the &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;editor, but are germane to writing in general). Learn to reduce the number and increase the efficiency of the keystrokes you make. Wean yourself from the mouse. And by all means look into &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/span&gt;, which is a most robust and efficient text editor (Bram is &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/span&gt;’s main creator). &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Vim &lt;/span&gt;was originally designed for the Unix operating system, and its current version is used mostly by &lt;a title=&quot;Ubuntu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; users (like me). However, &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;cream&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://cream.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Cream&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is a Vim equivalent for Windows. &lt;!--l. 314--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Vim &lt;/span&gt;is cryptic, has a steep learning curve, and some of its functions are improbably arcane. &lt;a title=&quot;Emacs&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another editor that originally evolved on Unix (and which I used to write the course reader) is similarly cryptic and powerful. In this sense, these editors mirror the writing process. Unlike word processors, which blanket that process, covering it with neat type, text editors lay bare your words and force you to face the page. &lt;!--l. 316--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Although &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Emacs &lt;/span&gt;and other minimalist tools (such as &lt;a title=&quot;BBEdit&quot; href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for the Mac) are used mostly by programmers, writers are increasingly recognizing the advantages of such tools. They are immeasurably more powerful and efficient for writing of all kinds. &lt;!--l. 318--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; In its beginnings and its evolution, the act of writing is about the bare bones, the essential, the elemental. Use a tool that delivers, rather than distracts, from that wonderful trajectory.

        <ALLTEXT> In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html&quot; title=&quot;In the Beginning was the Command Line&quot;&gt;famous essay&lt;/a&gt; about computers and culture, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nealstephenson.com/&quot; title=&quot;Neal Stephenson&quot;&gt;Neal Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; (a well-known American author) had this to say about the &lt;a title=&quot;Emacs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; text editor:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear word processor... It written in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional writer -- i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed -- emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Versions of Emacs are available for Linux, Mac (&lt;a title=&quot;Aquamacs&quot; href=&quot;http://aquamacs.org/&quot;&gt;Aquamacs&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a title=&quot;Emacs for Windows&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; </ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>Words: gotta use 'em, so use 'em good.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a transparent observation, but writing is made up of words. This week we examine our own preferences and proclivities with regard to words: those by which we are seduced, or bludgeoned, or which we neglect and abuse.
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My recommendation for beginning writing is as follows: do not start with sentences, with the easy and fluid liaisons of phrases, with the heft of lines upon lines stacking up. Instead, start with words, or perhaps with a single word. Find the words first. Then make of them a haiku. Then write a single sentence that fills the space of your creativity. But words first, always words.
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Writing and the Politics of Language 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 564--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;“Our words are similar to wells,” says the poet César Calvo, “and those wells can accommodate the most diverse waters: cataracts, drizzles of other times, oceans that were and will be of ashes, of human beings, and of tears as well. Our words are like people, and sometimes much more, not simple carriers of only one meaning.” &lt;!--l. 566--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Words have power, and presence, and a history of which we are sometimes unaware. It is prudent, as a writer, to use language consciously, to be as intentional as possible about tones and moods and the colors of the page. &lt;!--l. 568--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The following list is cautionary: yes, feel free to use the words on this list, and perhaps builds tropes (a hifalutin’ word) around them; but be aware of the impact such words may have, of their sharpness or fuzziness, of the surprising ways in which readers might respond. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;dl class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Slippery Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;…&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;have the peculiar quality that all definitions are provisional: creativity, multicultural, objectivity Self/self, universal, subjectivity, objectivity, consciousness, Mind/mind, culture, art, mind-body, bodymind, minority, cognition, fulfilment, dominant, soul, mainstream, gender, spirit (and spirituality), transformation, truth, internal, external, healing, enlightenment, growth &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Flag-Draping and Eyebrow-Raising Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;telegraph particular political perspectives: corporate, colonial, anything-centric, mindset, postcolonial, deep, ecology, liberal, conservative, radical, ahistorical, postmodern, therapeutic &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Hifalutin’ Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;…&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;are often used improperly in service of erudition: Cartesian, Newtonian, aesthetic, duality, modality, schema, construct, notion, praxis, hegemony, structural (con/de/post), pedagogy, liminal, archetype, paradigm (/shift), positivism, hermeneutic, teleology&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;

        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h3&gt;If You Must Write Using a Computer...
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Late in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/span&gt;, after Marlow has meandered deep into the jungle but before he meets Kurtz, who utters his now-famous judgement upon human nature, “The horror! The horror!” — before this, the most famous scene in twentieth century literature, Marlow finds himself making necessary repairs to the ship. He ruminates on these activities as distractions from the shadows around him, from the haunting underbelly of his own nature that he sees in the wilderness around him, in the passionate abandon of the local tribes-people. Here’s the full passage: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot; class=&quot;quotation&quot;&gt; &lt;!--l. 364--&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there — there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were — No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it — this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity — like yours — the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you — you so remote from the night of first ages — could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything — because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage — who can tell? — but truth — truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder — the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuff — with his own inborn strength. Principles won’t do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags — rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row — is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who’s that grunting? You wonder I didn’t go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no — I didn’t. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes — I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--l. 367--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Marlow employs seamanship as a kind of shield against the chaos, against the frightening shapes of his inner life. After all, he is a civilized man, an Englishman, for whom the shadow must be contained. Marlow is a sailor, one who traverses the waters but remains above them. Writers, conversely, are involved in plumbing those depths, in encountering their lights and shadows, in struggling with the full breadth of human propensity. &lt;!--l. 369--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; But we distract ourselves too, and the most common method of doing this is to allow the electronic world to continually divert us from the blank page and blinking cursor. Email alerts, news feeds, blogs: there is enough distraction in these things to doom the wisest writer. We must go into the darkness, into the bardo, to discover our treasures. That we often have difficulty doing so is, in part, due to the persistent emphasis of our environment upon the facile and the transient and the ephemeral. Always an update, a flashing notice, a clamoring icon which seems to confirm our importance — but in fact belies our addiction to the inconsequential. &lt;!--l. 371--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Writers have not been well-served by technology since about 1990, when the last console versions of &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;WordPerfect &lt;/span&gt;showed us a black screen upon which a small, blinking cursor waited patiently for us to dive into the waters. Since the advent of graphical user interfaces, the blackness has been hidden, has been replaced by smilies and floral wallpaper and pastel icons. I’m not against the &lt;span class=&quot;cmcsc-10&quot;&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;; but for writing, it’s a serious impediment, the modern equivalent of Marlow’s leaky steam pipes. &lt;!--l. 373--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The confrontation with what lies behind, or beneath, or hidden, is the essence of all good writing. And whether one perceives that hidden-ness as darkness, as Conrad did, or as a terrifying whiteness, as did Melville, the mystery is the same. Here’s Melville describing the peculiar terror evoked by the whiteness of the whale: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot; class=&quot;quotation&quot;&gt; &lt;!--l. 375--&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows — a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues — every stately or lovely emblazoning — the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge — pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--l. 378--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The writer approaches mystery by way of the white page or the black screen. That is our task, nothing more. Not to explain the mystery, or to resolve it, or to erase it; but to encounter it, struggle with it, allow it to enter and change us. This will not happen, cannot happen, if we are checking our emails and news feeds all day long. We must sit in silence, waiting for the mystery to descend. &lt;!--l. 380--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Now, from the mystic to the concrete: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;itemize1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Turn off all email notification. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Turn off all news notification. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Turn off software update notification. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Configure all desktop panels to “auto-hide.” 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Remove all icons from the desktop (organize yourself!). 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Choose a wallpaper that will not scream at you. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Close all browsers. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Do not use &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Microsoft Word &lt;/span&gt;(of which, much discourse elsewhere). 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Use a text-based editor such as &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;cream&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;emacs&lt;/span&gt;. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Learn to use the editor with keystrokes only (this takes time). 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;itemize&quot;&gt;Choose a color scheme for the editor that has high contrast and, ideally, a dark background.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;!--l. 395--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Write from the blinking cursor, with no other distractions. Just you and the waiting blackness (or whiteness, which amounts to the same thing). Reclaim the mystery.

        <SUMMARY>Putting words together.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>Words make sentences. In turn, sentences are the magic of writing. So, choose some of your favourites: from books, essays, poetry, or from your own writing. Post at least two outstanding sentences (from your point of view) that have been crafted by other writers. And write one sentence of your own. Make it as perfect as you can. Don't worry about how long or short it is. Consider it to be a tiny holograph of your writing life, a snippet, a haiku of your innermost visions. Post it!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Here are some examples of good sentences.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;dl class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Chris Hedges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;In wartime the state seeks to destroy its own culture.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Jorge Luis Borges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;It may be that universal history is the history of a handful of metaphors.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Stephen King&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Keri Hulme&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;He walks down the street.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Joseph Conrad&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;The Nellie&lt;/span&gt;, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;John Fowles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I was born in 1927, the only child of middle-class parents, both English, and themselves born in the grotesquely elongated shadow, which they never rose sufficiently above history to leave, of that monstrous dwarf Queen Victoria.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Sharon Butala&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Our house was haunted.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbxti-10&quot;&gt;Scott Sanders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I began life by supposing, as all children do, that my home ground was the world.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;

        <NAME>On Tightening Sentences</NAME>
        <TYPE>html</TYPE>
        <REFERENCE></REFERENCE>
        <SUMMARY> Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. (This is another version of one section of the tightening package from last week.)&lt;br /&gt;</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>
&lt;p&gt;For most of its history literature has taken the form of epic poetry. This history is long: five thousand years, perhaps much longer. And within the genre of epic poetry -- from the Egyptian Pyramid Texts to Homer to the Kalevala -- every word counts. The rhythm counts. Resonance and fluidity count. No slack exists in these texts, no lazy meanderings of phrase or structure. These ancients texts are spare, clean, and tight. We could learn a great deal from these archaic authors. There are reasons for the enduring quality of their texts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to be an epic poet:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write one sentence at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review the sentence before moving on. Make it as perfect as you can. Spend all day on one sentence if required (but don't spend too long...)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure your sentence contains the best words for what you are trying to say.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Examine the phrase order. Look for a tighter order, more spare or visceral or elegant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speak the sentence aloud. Find its rhythm and sonority. Tweak as required. Don't rush.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take out all extra words and lazy phrasings, especially those that are habitual. Excise adverbs, gerunds, and verb phrases (&amp;quot;there is...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I've done...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;We're going...&amp;quot;) whenever possible. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shorten the sentence if you can (without diminishing its meaning).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a short break, gaze out the window, return to the sentence, and review it once more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave it alone. Build your next sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing, in my view, builds sentence upon sentence. Each new contribution adds to the structure and the framework of clarity. Why go farther (Quick Tip: &amp;quot;farther&amp;quot; refers to distance or extent; &amp;quot;further&amp;quot; denotes an action in service of) -- why go farther down your creative track when the foundation is not yet established? I know, you have probably been told to just write, to get words on the page, to come back to them later and try to make sense of your scratchings. No, I am not a fan of this approach. I prefer to approach writing as a Zen-like activity, an action of the razor-sharp mind and open heart working together. Writing, for me, is not catharsis but clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a practical example. Here's a possible sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Down on Granville Street, where my grandfather's jewelry store used to be, there are now a bunch of old, boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this is a start. I'm trying to say something in this sentence: about change, nostalgia, perhaps about renewal. It's not yet clear. So, let's start with the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Down on Granville Street&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Down&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; are both prepositions, only one of which is required. Therefore we can make this first phrase more succinct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;On Granville Street&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, the second phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;where my grandfather's jewelry store used to be&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase is the heart of the sentence; it needs to be clear and strong. &lt;code&gt;Used to be&lt;/code&gt; is an awkward verb phrase. It tries to articulate, in three words, the nostalgia and ambivalence of the sentence. And yet, &lt;code&gt;used to be&lt;/code&gt; is almost devoid of meaning here. It is a marker and nothing more. Let's try something more robust and imaginal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;where my grandfather's jewelry store once stood&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;code&gt;once stood&lt;/code&gt; in this way, we're indicating the past in more resonant terms. We are also implying a fall -- what once stood, then fell. Also, we're implying a steadfastness of the old place, a sense of presence that was previously lacking. So far so good. Now, onto the tricky part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;there are now a bunch of old, boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a tidy mess. Too many things going on, too many overt indications when subtlety is called for. Not to mention the awkward phrase &lt;code&gt;a bunch of&lt;/code&gt;. Yikes. Where to begin? How about with some editing: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strike&gt;there are now a bunch of&lt;/strike&gt; old, boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, this makes things a bit easier. Now we have the rudiments of a decent clause, something about old buildings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;boarded-up buildings waiting quietly to be renovated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the gerunds and adverbs are typically (except right here!) to be avoided, so we can clean up the phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;boarded-up buildings wait to be renovated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;code&gt;tumbledown&lt;/code&gt; is a better word than &lt;code&gt;boarded-up&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ramshackle&lt;/code&gt; would be good here, too). And &lt;code&gt;wait to be renovated&lt;/code&gt; is awkward and anthropomorphic in a way that doesn't seem to suit the imagery of the sentence. And we might spruce up the language a bit with some alliteration (use sparingly!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tumbledown buildings lie in lethargy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better. But I keep thinking about &lt;code&gt;ramshackle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tumbledown&lt;/code&gt;. Could I use both? Let's see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ramshackle buildings lie in lethargy upon the tumbledown street.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this. But it will require that I abandon my theme of renewal. The sentence will be more sad without it, yet probably more authentic too. And less self-conscious. Let's try the whole thing out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;code&gt;On Granville Street, where my grandfather's jewelry store once stood, ramshackle buildings lie in lethargy upon the tumbledown street.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad. The sentence embodies nostalgia, sadness, personal and social loss, and something else -- but we don't know what yet. It's something about what happens next, or later, the contrast between the past and the present. The sentence itself leads me on, as its writer, to the next stage. It provokes me to think about contrasts, about words such as &lt;code&gt;glittering&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;forlorn&lt;/code&gt;, and about what we preserve and discard. I cannot write the next sentence without first the polished catalyst of the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, my grandfather did own a jewelry store on Granville Street, many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY> Grab the thread.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>This week we move to actual composition. We take the words and sentences and we put them together into a thematic core. We write with clarity, honesty, and precision. We make our narrative as long or as short as required (see my theme example).

You may have noticed that I have not spent a great deal of time in this course instructing you how to write. I'm encouraging you to find your way through on your own terms, in your own way. Nothing is worse (well, almost nothing) than a community of writers who all work the same way. Take the craft of magazine writing, for example: everyone knows about the hook, about not starting with the weather, about the hierarchies of paragraph structure -- and this is why almost all magazine writing is homogeneous, boring, conformist, dead (I'm thinking of Maclean's here, actually).

But this week we do explore mechanics and composition in a more focused way. Start by reading my notes about writing personal essays and by reading the sample essays. In the interests of full disclosure, I should tell you that I'm a great fan of the work of William Langewiesche. He is one of the great essayists of our day.

After you have read the notes and essays, write a theme-based piece that is your own, in your own voice. Don't worry about rules, or how it should be done. Worry instead about tightening it: remove the excess words, the muddiness, the lazy adverbs and passive voice. Speak directly, from your own creative imagination.

Post your theme-based essay to the forum for this week. Also send a (plain text!) copy to me, through the assignment page. Also, please comment on each of the other submissions. When I say &quot;comment&quot; what I mean is: find something you like about the piece, something that seems rich or resonant in it. Please do not make uninvited criticisms or suggestions for improvement. That's my job (among other things). For your part, contribute to the community of the course in a positive way. Say something positive, helpful, encouraging.

Remember: there is no length guideline for this project. It should be as long as it needs to be (which, usually, means that it should be longer than you think).</ALLTEXT>

        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;The Jasper Queen
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 473--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;The indomitable spirit cannot be diminished — by negligence, by war, by time spun farther than the grasp of memory. This occurs to me on September ninth, in the Egyptian gallery of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, as I stand before the only remaining fragment of an ancient sculpture. The body has vanished, and most of the head is gone. What remains is a small artefact, about six inches high: an elegant mouth — smiling, in repose — and the beginning curve of a face, carved from yellow jasper. Between ragged fractures where the stone is sheared off — one just above the top lip, the other below the chin — the mouth has been sculpted with astonishing precision by the craft of a culture now strewn across the debris field of history. This statue, all that’s left of the queen of a remote age, was fashioned in devotion and shattered by war, almost twenty-five centuries ago. And still, she smiles. &lt;!--l. 475--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; I remain in the gallery for a long while, absorbing the details of this remarkable object: bright and smooth, polished to a high sheen. Yellow jasper, symbol of the imperishable, the rain-bringer, a stone reputed to drive away evil spirits, has long been associated with healing. Perhaps this mouth, so fragile, the instrument of a forgotten voice, has been preserved by virtue of the jasper’s protection. This relic endures, even as the Taliban destroy stone Buddhas in Afghanistan. In countless guises, the instinct for beauty prevails. Two days later, back home in British Columbia, as I prepare to work a stone I found on the mountain north of where I live, terrorists fly hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, into the Pentagon, into the ground. Like their ancient allies, they tear down the standing stones, endeavor to destroy all that is foreign and strange. The old fires have not stopped burning. &lt;!--l. 478--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; I am drawn away from the shop and into my grief for many days. I sit with my wife in the quiet sanctuary she has made of our yard. The first ochre leaves appear, and we wonder how to make sense of such unfathomable events. My eight-year-old daughter writes a poem about the end of summer, in which birds fly to nice, warm places. Safe passage. As the season turns, I pray that I find the wisdom to weigh, in my own small and quotidian life, the will to heal against the wish to harm. &lt;!--l. 480--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; When I can no longer abide images from the television, when the rawness within me must be assuaged, I return to my workbench. My affliction is softened as I cradle my tools and guide them across the stone, restoring a shattered visage. The dust gathers into great storm clouds as I work, falls like ash onto every surface of my shop. The facade of the stone cracks, gathers itself into the contours of a resolute chin, a strong mouth and a cheek rising toward a restful eye. &lt;!--l. 482--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Rage and tears and a strange dread, lurking and tenebrous, find their way into the rhythm of my work. Bits of loose stone fall onto the floor, abrade my skin with their sharp edges, scrape the benchtop I so carefully protect from harm. I persist, straining to reclaim, in the grain of dark stone, the soft faces of those now lost to our sight. I mourn the death, too, of the isolated innocence of my culture. And I try to answer the questions of my four-year-old son, who cannot understand why the hijackers would hurt anyone. He devises surprisingly elaborate plans for talking to them, for asking them to stop. &lt;!--l. 484--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; He watches me work, brings me tools, draws close in this time of elemental fear. My hands, searching for the stone’s redemption, trace their way across the emerging contours of a jaw, and the rough edge where the forehead will be. I imagine the craftsmen of the jasper queen, and I wonder, as I inspect my work during a bright and warm afternoon, if it’s her voice I hear, humming among the trees out back. I discover, once again, that the simple work of hands is a guide in my own healing. I am shaped by the work of creativity as a stone is by tools. And I am sustained, finally, by the hope that my one stone might stand with the destroyed and colossal Buddhas, with the scattered and the fallen, with those on their way back home. &lt;!--l. 486--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Creativity can be a deep sustenance — whether in stone or wood or soil. And though my carving is crude, fails utterly to match the surpassing skill of those ancient craftsmen, I persevere; for the work of creation calls not only to the practiced hand. Slowly, easing into the surface, I peel back the many layers that hide the finished face. The air is thick with transformations. &lt;!--l. 488--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; I wash dust from the stone. The bright surface beneath, smoothed by countless tool strokes, appears alive. Dark striations weave their way across the rudimentary cheek, and flecks of white — feldspar — scatter like snowflakes along the brow. There’s more work, much more: the nose, the eyes, the left side of the jaw. But I’ve begun. And as I gaze upon the face before me, collected from the ashes of mountains and the visions of my own troubled days, I glimpse a woman both serene and fair. She looks upon our fractured world with an indomitable spirit. And she smiles.

        <SUMMARY>Some thoughts on a revered genre.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p&gt;A personal essay is a non-fiction creative writing essay in which the author utilizes the perspective of personal experience to articulate larger themes (in traditional literary criticism, such themes were once termed “universal”). A personal essay focuses on the perceptions and feelings of the author and uses these to reflect upon subjects such as nature, politics, history, culture, and literature. The personal essay derives its impact from the integration of individual and universal considerations. This integration allows the reader to explore the unity of human experience. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A few exceptional personal essays have been sufficiently powerful as to change the literary and cultural landscape. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bronowski&quot;&gt;Jacob Bronowski&lt;/a&gt;’s series of personal essays based on his visit to the ruins of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 (essays such as &lt;em&gt;The Face of Violence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Abacus and the Rose&lt;/em&gt;) helped initiate the now long-standing debate about the place and limits of science. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Berry&quot;&gt;Wendell Berry&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt; was instrumental in articulating the philosophy of the current environmental movement. And, within the last couple of years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Langewiesche&quot;&gt;William Langewiesche&lt;/a&gt;’s personal essays about his experiences in Iraq have significantly shaped views of the Iraq war. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As creative non-fiction, personal essays blend together the composition techniques of various genres including narrative fiction, journalism, natural history, and historiography. Multiple points of view may be used, as well as ruminative passages, personal vignettes and philosophical reflections. This flexibility gives personal essays a tremendous range, and is one reason they have been a favorite mode of expression for many writers. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As in every genre, some examples are foundational. Below are a few personal essays that have earned wide circulation. You may recognize some of these authors from their longer works. The first two of the essays listed below are in your reader; the last two are posted in this week's reading section.

&lt;p&gt;E..B. White, &lt;em&gt;Once More to the Lake&lt;/em&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt;Wendell Berry, &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt;Stanton Michaels, &lt;em&gt;How to Write a Personal Essay&lt;/em&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt;William Langewiesche, &lt;em&gt;Hotel Baghdad: Fear and Lodging in Iraq&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take these essays one at a time, starting with &lt;em&gt;Once More to the Lake&lt;/em&gt;. E.B. White lived and wrote during a time in which people still thought of literature as a classical art with specific forms. His writing sounds more formal than much of what we read today. And yet, “No one can write a sentence like White,” as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thurber&quot;&gt;James Thurber&lt;/a&gt; once said. Indeed, E.B. White is the “White” of the much-beloved style guide called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style&quot;&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/a&gt;. More than any other single compositional text, &lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt; is responsible for the tone and style of much twentieth century writing. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt; lists eight elementary rules and ten elementary principles of good writing. I’ve reproduced this list below. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Elementary rules of usage 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Form the possessive singular of nouns with ’s. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Place a comma before ‘and’ or ‘but’ introducing an independent clause. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not join independent clauses by a comma. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not break sentences in two. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Elementary principles of composition 
&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use the active voice. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Put statements in positive form. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Omit needless words. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid a succession of loose sentences. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Keep related words together. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In summaries, keep to one tense. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The guide also offers various tips and suggestions regarding style. (Here are most of them, sourced, along with the lists above, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements_of_style&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: 1. Place yourself in the background. 2. Write in a way that comes naturally. 3. Work from a suitable design. 4. Write with nouns and verbs. 5. Revise and rewrite. 6. Do not overwrite. 7. Do not overstate. 8. Avoid the use of qualifiers. 9. Do not affect a breezy manner. 10. Use orthodox spelling. 11. Do not explain too much. 12. Do not construct awkward adverbs. 13. Make sure the reader knows who is speaking. 14. Avoid fancy words. 15. Do not use dialect unless your ear is good. 16. Be clear. 17. Do not inject opinion. 18. Use figures of speech sparingly. 19. Do not take shortcuts at the cost of clarity. 20. Avoid foreign languages. 21. Prefer the standard to the offbeat.) 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Beginning writers typically struggle most with the “omit needless words” guideline as well as the suggestions not to “explain too much” and to “be clear.” But as you read &lt;em&gt;Once More to the Lake&lt;/em&gt;, notice that White is a consummate walker of his talk. You may easily find examples of his adherence to all of the above principles and practices. But can you also find where he has strayed from those guidelines? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What do you think is going on with White’s attitude toward technology in the essay? Read carefully when you get to the passage about the outboard motor. Does White seem to be anti-technological here, or is he simply trying to work out the place of technology? Remember, he’s writing during the 1950’s, a time when many people thought that global nuclear war was inevitable. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Is this an essay about aging? About nostalgia? About childhood? About family? Or is it all of those things strung together? And if they are strung together, how—precisely—does White accomplish this? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time on the passage near the end, when the son puts on the wet swim trunks. Literary folks have been talking about this passage for years. There’s something compelling about it. What do you think is going on? What are we supposed to take from this passage, and from the essay in general? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In another essay called &lt;em&gt;Here is New York&lt;/em&gt;, published a few years before &lt;em&gt;Once More to the Lake&lt;/em&gt;, White spoke about the vulnerability of New York in the nuclear age: 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The city, for the first time in its long history, is destructible. A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate the millions. The intimation of mortality is part of New York in the sound of the jets overhead, in the black headlines of the latest edition. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This passage was widely quoted after September 11. Its enduring quality makes the case that well-written prose can persist, beyond the lifetime of its author, beyond the norms and currents of a given historical period. We will see this same type of enduring quality in the work of Wendell Berry. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But before jumping into Wendell Berry, let me ask you a question: do you know who &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Stegner&quot;&gt;Wallace Stegner&lt;/a&gt; was? If you have heard of him, I will be impressed with your literary knowledge. But most Canadians would draw a blank on the name. Which is unfortunate, because Stegner has been a strong influence on current Canadian writers such as Sharon Butala. He grew up in Saskatchewan (where today there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stegnerhouse.ca/&quot;&gt;Stegner House&lt;/a&gt;, a creative writing centre). But Stegner lived much of his live in the United States (where he founded the Creative Writing program at Stanford University), and this is likely the main reason he is not more familiar to Canadians. Much of Stegner’s writing might broadly be called ecological, or environmental, and the strain of environmental writing that we now see coming out of central Canada owes much to him. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wendell Berry was a student of Wallace Stegner’s, at Stanford—as were Ken Kesey, Sandra Day O’Connor, and Larry McMurtry. (McMurtry wrote the screenplay for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain&quot;&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.) And like the other luminaries of that program, Berry has had a long and well-respected career. He is, in many ways, the defining archetype of the phrase “a sense of place.” In &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt;, we can see the strong environmental ethic in his work, the sense of earthiness and embodiment. It’s as though Berry takes the struggle of E.B. White—how to balance nature with human ambition?—and shows another path, an integrative path where we can once again find our connection to the natural world. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While you read &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt;, try to focus on the rhythm of the piece: the slowing down of Berry’s thoughts and impressions, the way in which he asks us to slow down with him, the careful way in which he structures the beginning of the essay so that we follow him into the woods—which are a metaphor for what? Or are they a metaphor at all? What do “the woods” mean? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And later, as we’re reaching the centre of the piece, what’s going on with those inscriptions that Berry finds? What’s he trying to tell us? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Again, as with E.B. White’s essay, we need to ask ourselves what exactly Berry is doing to create the mood and the momentum of his narrative. Is he using some (or all) of the principles in &lt;em&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/em&gt;, or is he developing his own methods? And how similar are Berry’s methods to those of other contemporary writers? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As a review, and as a diversion to refresh your attention, take a moment now to scoot over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/writebetter&quot;&gt;A List Apart’s Writing Guide&lt;/a&gt; and compare their guidelines to what you are seeing in &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt;. Notice that Dennis Mahoney’s guide advocates a specific relationship to the so-called rules of writing: 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best rules can’t be stated, but you can learn them by reading excellent writing. Develop an ear. If you know what works, you’ll start to emulate it. Conversely, it’s good to study truly horrendous language, stuff that makes you embarrassed for those responsible. You’ll find yourself mortally afraid of—and automatically avoiding—the same mistakes in your own writing. Hemingway said, “The most essential gift for a good writer is a built–in shock–proof shit-detector.” (They’re cheap if you haven’t already got one.) This is especially important for web writers, most of whom are publishing without the benefit of editors. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to that last sentence about publishing without an editor. That’s you, right? And sometimes me, and often anyone who wants to place words on a page (or a screen). Read well. Develop an ear. Find what works, and why. Stop using adverbs (my favorite tip). And, just for good measure, pay attention to the various brief writing guides that come out now and then on the web. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holtuncensored.com/ten_mistakes.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a good one.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Back to Berry. &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt; is an essay about stewardship (among other things), which is the essence of Berry’s writing. And this stewardship has a long reach: into politics, culture, economics, and government policy. Recently, at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lindsey.edu/index.cgi?id=10379&quot;&gt;commencement speech at Lindsey Wilson College&lt;/a&gt;, Berry said: 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The line that connects the bombing of civilian populations to the mountain removed by strip mining … to the tortured prisoner seems to run pretty straight. We’re living, it seems, in the culmination of a long warfare—warfare against human beings, other creatures and the Earth itself. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;So: how is it that Berry is able to make statements such as those above—which are direct and highly charged politically—and to write about nature with such gentleness? And, if you read &lt;em&gt;An Entrance to the Woods&lt;/em&gt; carefully, how is it that Berry is able to imply statements such as the one above but without coming right out with them? How has he hidden the directness of his message so skilfully? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. It’s an important question. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next we move on to Stanton Michaels’ &lt;em&gt;How to Write a Personal Essay (Intro. Three main points. Summary. Sex)&lt;/em&gt;. This essay is the only work by Stanton Michaels of which I am aware. He is not a well-known writer, has not won any awards, is not schmoozing with literati at Pulitzer galas. He has written one great piece. It was originally published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uga.edu/garev/&quot;&gt;The Georgia Review&lt;/a&gt;, in which Wendell Berry has published numerous pieces. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the beginning: 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The easiest way to write a personal essay is to use the standard form taught in Composition 101: an introductory paragraph followed by three paragraphs outlining three main points and a final summary paragraph. But instead of just blathering about yourself, describe vivid scenes and what they mean to you, such as when your 2-year-old son, Jordan, solemnly declares from the bathtub “I can’t swim—my penis is hard” and you tell him it’s OK, it’s normal, knowing it’ll subside and he’ll be able to swim soon, but you don’t tell him that teeny little weenie he’s holding will be the source of the most intense worries, sorrows, and pleasures he’ll ever experience, and you wonder if you’ll ever be able to tell him the truth. You could follow this thought with the trials and tribulations of your own penis, unless you’re a woman—but of course females are involved with love, sex, and life built around their own body parts, which can provide many interesting topics. The key to maintaining reader interest is to be open and honest, displaying your concerns and fears through specific, true-life examples rather than abstract concepts about how you think sex education is important because you learned the hard way on your own and you doubt you’ll explain things any better than your own father did. Follow this format and, while you may not become a world-renowned author, you will be able to complete a personal essay. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How many compositional rules did Michaels just break? I count at least six. And what’s with the interminable sentences? And the loose language? And the meandering narrative? But wait—take a few minutes now and read it all the way through… 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And you discover, despite your reservations, that this is one fine piece of writing: personal, evocative, expressive. And it’s five paragraphs, as promised, comprising precisely 2500 words (go ahead and count ‘em; I did). 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What makes this work? After all, it does break most of the rules. But ask yourself: how could Michaels have articulated any better the joy and pain of the phases of his life that he describes? It works, I suggest, because the entire essay is &lt;em&gt;in Michael’s own distincitve voice&lt;/em&gt;, which is quirky and eccentric and disarmingly honest. It’s as though he’s not simply writing but inviting us to witness the inner workings of his mind and heart. &lt;em&gt;How to Write a Personal Essay&lt;/em&gt; starts out with humour and thereby disarms us, so that later, when the more difficult and intense material comes, we are not quite ready for it, we are still open and undefended. The material goes right in. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It’s often said that an artist first must learn to use the rules and then learn to break them. It seems an accurate statement with regard to Stanton Michaels. What I’d like for you to take from this piece, to remember after reading it, is that the rules are always subservient to the writer’s own authentic voice. And that voice, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad&quot;&gt;Joseph Conrad&lt;/a&gt; said, “cannot be silenced.” 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Joseph Conrad, who is a great source of inspiring literary ditties: he once stated his artistic aim as follows: 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel… before all, to make you see. That—and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, consolation, fear, charm—all you demand—and, perhaps, also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s consider William Langewiesche’s &lt;em&gt;Hotel Baghdad: Fear and Lodging in Iraq&lt;/em&gt;. Langewiesche is considered to to be a pioneer of the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newnewjournalism.com/bio.php?last_name=langewiesche&quot;&gt;new new journalism&lt;/a&gt;, which is another way of saying creative non-fiction. Langewiesche is the son of a pilot and writer who composed a fine book of personal essays, entitled &lt;em&gt;Rudder and Stick&lt;/em&gt;, that would be very much at home on our list of outstanding works. In &lt;em&gt;Hotel Baghdad&lt;/em&gt;, Langewiesche describes his experience of trying to survive the Iraq war. Notice his stark prose style, the way in which he utilizes both personal and impersonal perspectives, the manner of his interdisciplinary discussion of various related topics. In many ways, Langewiesche is a writer of tremendous rigour, in the spirit of E.B. White. His writing is spare and formal, though utterly engaging. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;What do you think he is trying to say when he talks about sweeping bullet casings from the balcony? And, in his discussion of the Green Zone, how does he articulate (or hide) his own political views? 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Choose a paragraph—any paragraph—and notice how Langewiesche adheres strongly to the principle &lt;em&gt;omit needless words&lt;/em&gt;. And yet, Langewiesche’s essays on the rebuilding of the World Trade Center (later published in book form as &lt;em&gt;American Ground&lt;/em&gt;) were the longest articles ever published by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic Monthly&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the finest literary magazine in the United States. Tight prose facilitates, rather than precludes, thorough expression. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the three essays as a whole. Which is your favorite? Why? What is the one scene or vignette that resonates with you the most? What technique does the author use to create that resonant mood? And how can you create that mood yourself?

      &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;The easiest way to write a personal essay is to use the standard form taught in Composition 101: an introductory paragraph followed by three paragraphs outlining three main points and a final summary paragraph. But instead of just blathering about yourself, describe vivid scenes and what they mean to you, such as when your 2-year-old son, Jordan, solemnly declares from the bathtub &quot;I can't swim--my penis is hard&quot; and you tell him it's OK, it's normal, knowing it'll subside and he'll be able to swim soon, but you don't tell him that teeny little weenie he's holding will be the source of the most intense worries, sorrows, and pleasures he'll ever experience, and you wonder if you'll ever be able to tell him the truth. You could follow this thought with the trials and tribulations of your own penis, unless you're a woman--but of course females are involved with love, sex, and life built around their own body parts, which can provide many interesting topics. The key to maintaining reader interest is to be open and honest, displaying your concerns and fears through specific, true-life examples rather than abstract concepts about how you think sex education is important because you learned the hard way on your own and you doubt you'll explain things any better than your own father did. Follow this format and, while you may not become a world-renowned author, you will be able to complete a personal essay.
&lt;p&gt; Use five sentences in each paragraph. Some authors, like Faulkner, write immensely long sentences that drift into nooks and crannies of life, enlightening the reader about how, at age 16, you were tricked by a girl into trying on ring sets from her mom's jewelry-making equipment to find your ring size and later presented with a black onyx and silver ring you were too scared to wear because it implied going steady, which leads to sex, and Dad had just given you and your brother a box of Trojans the week before when Mom and Brooke had gone shopping at Sears for dresses and you were as uncomfortable as Dad when he grunted out his heart-to-heart &quot;Use these to be safe,&quot; especially since you'd recently calculated and realized he'd knocked Mom up with you when she was 16 and he was out of the army after a four-year hitch and you figured it must have happened by accident since their meeting was accidental, him picking her and her sisters up at a railroad crossing in the rain on Halloween and giving them a ride home, coming later to visit, finally getting down in April without a condom or maybe with one that broke and there you are in December but at least they'd gotten married over the summer and you realize it's April now and you stare at the ring and finally throw it away and tell her later you don't wear jewelry. Tough guys like Hemingway write short, straightforward sentences, such as: &quot;The author stopped typing. His thick fingers lay bare on the keyboard. Although he's been married for eight years, his ring finger is naked. His wife knows he doesn't wear jewelry. Ever.&quot; Yet other writers like to mix up the lengths of their sentences, using long, compound run-ons that begin with one thought then drive on to others but eventually circle back for completion, then follow with a short, crisp, prissy sentence that would satisfy an eighth-grade grammar teacher. Not me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Write about things you've done or people you know, introducing your first true love or your first sexual encounter at age 17 crammed in the back of a Volkswagen Beetle with Danielle who will do it for free 'cause she has a crush on you and you need the experience to be ready for your true first time with Julie whom you love and can't get off your mind while you're wedged against the cold side window, remembering Julie's taste, the force of her tongue in your mouth, the way she holds your hard-on like she knows what she wants and you need to be sure how to do it exactly right so here you are pumping away feeling cheap and drunk and ashamed and excited and sore and thinking sex should be a lot more fun or magical than this floundering on the back seat. You can write in sober first person (&quot;I found later with Julie I didn't need the practice session with Danielle&quot;), but some feel this is self-serving and others, such as myself, need the safe distance from slivers of memory provided by humor, misdirection, and second or even third person (&quot;At least he wore a condom both times&quot;). Don't take examples from television or books or newspapers unless they have an effect on you. Don't write about Kurt Cobain's suicide after achieving fatherhood or Jimi and Janis overdosing when you were a teen unless you're a musician--even a part-time folk-rock banjo-picker--wondering how you ever made it out of adolescence since you were so horny yet scared of sex you could only function by smoking a joint first thing in the morning to slow down your thoughts yet still dragged home at midnight after playing a party and jerked off into a dark toilet bowl before passing out in bed worried if you'd wake the next morning and mostly hoping you wouldn't, having all these memories from those horrid nights years ago cascade through your mind when you returned home from a jam session last Wednesday night a little drunk and then--after checking on Jordan and his sister sleeping peacefully--crying for Kurt who'll never know his own child and crying for Jim Morrison and Carla Hill and Randy Batson who died in a car accident in high school and all the others you remember, knowing it was just luck you made it and they didn't, finally wiping away the tears as you piss tequila residue into a murky toilet before going to sleep knowing you're gonna drag tomorrow at work but sure you'll wake up in time as you always do. Write about universal themes you've experienced personally and others can relate to, like love, fear, and death--or sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.
  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;Use specific examples that stick to one theme. Don't write generically about how condoms might break when you can write specifically about the first time with Melanie who'd just gotten over an abortion and her new IUD wasn't ready yet so you ran back to your cabin at the summer camp where you were both counselors to get the jet-black, ribbed Love Machine you'd bought in a gas station in North Carolina and carried for two years for just such an occasion but after shredded pieces of black latex dripping with semen fell onto the rumpled sheets and Melanie stared like it was a loaded shotgun pointed right at her belly and all you could do was shrug &quot;Sorry&quot; and the only worry on your mind was when your next day off was so you could get to town and buy some that worked because this first time with her was what you'd always hoped sex would finally turn out to be--a fun, relaxed sharing of talk, laughter, and touch. Stick to one theme. Don't write about Carla Hill in ninth grade when you were 14 if you're writing about your sex life because she was murdered before anything happened, her throat cut in her own bed during an attempted rape the night before you'd finally mustered up enough courage to ask her to go steady and your buddies had helped you out by sitting in all the seats in the front, right-hand side of the bus where she always sat, leaving the only open space right next to you so she'd just have to sit there and you had your name bracelet all ready but she never got on and everyone else was sobbing, telling you about it. I feel that stories like that, despite being of possible interest, lack relevance to the major themes of &quot;your sex life&quot; in this essay and should be saved for some other piece of writing--unless, of course, you can tie the story in using a new focus, perhaps discovered while writing the essay, such as maybe realizing your refusal to wear jewelry has nothing to do with your dad, condoms, and pregnancy but is instead related somehow to your first attempt at commitment that went totally sour and you simply compensated in the best way your 14-year-old mind could think of.
&lt;p&gt; Personal essays come in all kinds. Some are forms of reportage, such as those by John McPhee or Tracy Kidder, telling the truths about people they've interviewed yet injecting the honesty of the reporter's perception rather than trying to pretend a writer has no slant that skews a story. Other essays deal with decisions made, such as when you finally decide to make a baby and Cheryl leaves her diaphragm out for the first time in 14 years and you laugh as you remember getting sick of her mom asking about grandkids and telling her you both wanted to get really good at sex before doing it for real and now here you are for real and scared if you'll be good enough, and you're not talking just about sex now. Essays can also be speculative: questions about found objects, thoughts about missed opportunities and things that never were, or memories that haunt you such as Lindsey in Washington, D.C., who lived in an all-women's house that banned men and made you stand outside in the snow when you came over to get some banjo books abandoned by a former tenant but something happened and Lindsey moved into your room the weekend you hitched down to North Carolina as bodyguard and companion to her friend Rose and stayed when you got back to hump you two or three times a night until you got so raw you could hardly walk and with no talk or even real emotion of love or commitment to prevent you leaving a month later, but now you remember how there also wasn't any talk of contraception because you'd assumed she took care of it since she was so much older, yet now you jerk awake in the middle of the night years later with the stark realization that a lesbian has no need of IUDs or diaphragms or the pill but she does need something to make a baby of her own and maybe there's a little Stan Junior walking around someplace who is 6 years older now than you were then and you wonder if he's as naive as you suddenly discover you were (probably still are) and the only minuscule iota of relief you can find is that at least you'll never have to give him that man-to-man about the birds and bees. By baring your life, using concrete situations and honest thoughts, and following the basic rules of grammar and composition, you too can write a personal essay in 25 sentences.

&lt;br /&gt;Originally published in The Atlantic Monthly, May 2005
&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p icap=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/images/dc-m.gif&quot; alt=&quot;M&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt; y current home in Baghdad is the fifth in a year, and a fragile refuge from kidnappings and murder. It is a small hotel, and one of the few establishments in town still willing to accept the risk of sheltering Westerners. It has twenty-five suites and six single rooms on six floors, and stands two blocks off a ruined boulevard, on a street that is partially blocked by concrete blast walls. The blast walls form an imperfect compound that contains my hotel and another, larger one also willing to accept foreigners, along with a few houses and several apartment buildings where ordinary Iraqis reside. Though pedestrians walk freely through gates and gaps in the walls, there is only one way in for cars, and it is guarded by men carrying Kalashnikovs, who open trunks and hoods, and use a mirror on a pole to check the undersides for bombs. The guards come under fire from traffic on the boulevard, but this is considered to be minor stuff, which they answer by enthusiastically firing back. I can mention such details without concern for the consequences, because nearly everyone in Baghdad knows about this place already. Mortar rounds fly overhead destined for the fortified Green Zone, about a half mile away across the Tigris River, and several car bombs have exploded nearby (one recently with the force to blow out windows here), but so far no building in the compound has suffered a direct rocket attack. The immunity may be intentional, since the compound serves the insurgency as a useful collection point from which Westerners emerge to brave the streets in their cars; certainly the exits are watched, cars have been followed and chased, and residents have been kidnapped. But the more likely explanation is that richer targets still exist elsewhere in the city, and the insurgents simply haven't gotten around to this one yet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hotel has an awning that stretches forward to the street over an unused entrance path bounded by chains as if to control crowds at a gala celebration. The entrance path leads up a few steps to a small glass-fronted restaurant with a locked door. The restaurant is usually empty. In the mornings, a few guests take breakfast there, of instant coffee, stale bread, and imitation honey. Most of the guests are Iraqi men employed by Western companies. They rarely talk. I have been told that this is because they are tense. The hotel's working entrance stands beside the restaurant, and is also glass-fronted. Inside is a miniature lobby, with a high reception desk and a bald clerk who sits low behind it, handing out and retrieving room keys. There is an elevator big enough for three people in a pinch. It is rarely used, because the national power frequently fails, and when it does, the standby generator often won't start. Across from the reception desk is a benchlike sofa against the wall, where sometimes two or three Iraqi men sit smoking silently. I figure they are not quite unemployed, because simply by proximity to Westerners they expose themselves to considerable risk, but I do not know who they are. They are reliably polite. In the cold months they wear leather jackets. At least one provides security, which means that in case of trouble he might fire a pistol or otherwise make noise. Late at night he locks and unlocks the glass front door. If you ask, he will also unlock a little glass case in the lobby, displaying a jumble of tarnished jewelry and other trinkets that no one buys. There is a painting nearby, apparently for sale, of a woman in a red dress lying alluringly on her back, while a white horse hovers strangely in the air above her. It has bothered me vaguely that the horse can fly but does not have wings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel is called Arth Al-Zuhoor. The name is written in Arabic on a small sign hanging outside, on which it is translated into English as &quot;the Flowers Land,&quot; and further defined as a &quot;tourist hotel.&quot; The sign is the original. It dates from the hotel's opening, in October of 2001, in the era of Saddam Hussein. Just what kind of tourists the owners had in mind is unclear. The manager then is the manager now. He is a well-fed middle-aged man. His name is Mr. Haider. He has a grand office in the back with an upholstered desk, a television tuned to an Egyptian channel, and a set of soft creamy sofas and chairs. He is friendly but dignified. He serves Turkish coffee to people who stop by. He once went out of his way to assure me that the Flowers Land is the safest establishment in all of Baghdad. He was talking about the war, not the food. He claimed that the neighborhood is inhabited by peaceful retirees, and that it enjoys the city's best weather, too—warmer in the winter, and a bit cooler for the rest of the year. From this I concluded that he has not given up on the tourist idea. He is pragmatic, however, and has no objection to his current clientele—the occasional mercenary, a few second-string reporters, maybe a French photographer or two, and larger numbers of Iraqi drivers and guards. When they are all added together, the hotel is rarely full. The suites cost about $100 a night. Residents walk in and out carrying weapons, and sit in their rooms discussing the available angles of fire and the usefulness of tossing grenades down the stairwells to slow a determined assault.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guns are tools that beg to be used. The Flowers Land is a latent battlefield. It is a six-floor, twenty-five-suite, six-single-room arsenal with a dangerous restaurant serving greasy kabobs. Mr. Haider originally wanted to call it Arth Al-Mahabba, or &quot;the Lovely Land,&quot; but names in Iraq were regulated by the Baathist regime, and when he went to an agency for a &quot;scientific search,&quot; he discovered that this one was not on the approved list. Prudently he decided that Lovely Land was a better name for a garden than a hotel. He had experienced a similar disappointment before. He had wanted to call his daughter Rose, but had been told that he could not. This irritated him for years, because he loved his daughter, and had a special affection for flowers. Indeed, his second choice for naming the hotel was the Gardenia—but after another scientific search this, too, was disallowed. It seemed that gardenias were meant to be flowers only, and not to be confused with any business or building. Mr. Haider swerved adroitly, and came up with the name Qasr Al-Zuhoor, or &quot;the Flowers Palace.&quot; This time the denial was tinged with a warning: Flowers Palace was a former name for the grand British-built edifice now called the Republican Palace, where Saddam Hussein held forth. Did Mr. Haider really believe that his hotel merited the comparison? No, emphatically not, and the thought hadn't even crossed his mind. Swerving again, he came upon the idea of the Flowers Land, another name for a garden, obviously, but one that for mysterious reasons sailed through the scientific search and emerged as the name of a hotel. Publicly, Mr. Haider was satisfied. Privately, he held a grudge. He did not exactly wave the Stars and Stripes when the United States invaded, eighteen months after he hung up the sign, but immediately afterward he renamed his daughter Rose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were golden times for people like him. After the first few unsettled weeks the streets were relatively safe, room rates were high, and thousands of foreigners came flocking in, spilling their bundles of cash. Along with all the journalists in town, there were gamblers and schemers of every sort, most of them jockeying for imagined contracts with the American occupation government, many of them living hard. They hired cars, and wandered the country far and wide, and when they returned to Baghdad, they sat around in the hotel bars swapping lies, and in some cases getting extraordinarily drunk. I remember one night in a large hotel across town watching a Russian fall right off his stool. It was late, and I was astonished that he could get so drunk yet stay awake to do it. Mortar rounds were dropping into the neighborhood just then, some close enough to send shock waves through our chests. The Russian's companion, dispassionately observing his friend on the floor, assured me that the idiot knew damned well there was no need yet to take cover. Those people were brave, I guess. They were certainly enterprising. But over the months that followed, as the war intensified, it gradually became clear that the deals were being made in Washington and not here, and one by one the business people disappeared. Other foreigners departed too, out of frustration or fear. Some managed to burrow into the Green Zone, where they continue to hustle for scraps among the American officials in that world of near total isolation. But enduring the culture of the Green Zone is a high price to pay for professional success, and most foreigners opted to go home instead. Their exodus has left the hotels almost exclusively to the press. Though the ranks have thinned, the number of reporters who remain is sufficient to allow for the survival of the few places defensible enough to let them in. Location is everything in Baghdad hotels. That is the real reason for Mr. Haider's continuing success. Of course he is enterprising and brave. But he is also simply lucky. When he promotes the Flowers Land for its tourist appeal, it is inconceivable that anyone is fooled. The Flowers Land endures because it is safely withdrawn from the boulevards, and happens to stand directly across the street from an establishment that for similar reasons has become the most popular in town—a hotel called the Hamra.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamra was named after the family that owns it, without any need, therefore, for a scientific search. It is twice as large as the Flowers Land. It is vulnerable to rocket attack, but difficult to bomb with a car. Its entrance door remains locked at all times. The door is protected by a steel grille, and is assiduously guarded by men armed with Kalashnikovs. People entering are sometimes searched. They are expected to leave their weapons at a desk, and some do. This makes for an artificially civilized atmosphere inside. There are two buildings, each of which has a small reception desk. They are known as Buildings One and Two. They contain suites, all with stoves and sinks, some with one bedroom, some with two. Building One has a coffee shop, with a long menu of Iraqi and Chinese food. Building Two has a bakery. In between them, and protected by high concrete walls, is a split-level deck containing a swimming pool. The pool is the cleanest in Baghdad, and has much to do with the Hamra's fame. Back in the golden times, especially during the first summer and fall following the invasion, it was the center of an evening social scene that had all the makings of a beach party. Think barbecues, bikinis, and beer. This was a war in which a large number of women were involved, both as correspondents and as aid workers. The men and women tended to be unattached, unafraid, and young. As a result, at the Hamra there was a lot of shacking-up going on. There was a lot of casual sex. This is no longer so true. The casual types have gone away, leaving reduced crews of serious and hard-pressed people behind. More important, as the value of the entire adventure has come increasingly into question, the romance of being in Baghdad has simply worn thin. At the Hamra the swimming pool is now left largely alone, and the other public spaces seem strangely empty; the residents have withdrawn to work in their rooms, and one would hardly suspect that most of the time both buildings are full.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hotel has inner defenses that cannot safely be described. Suffice it to say that the Hamra would be hard to take even for a large group of &lt;i&gt;mujahideen&lt;/i&gt; with suicidal intent. Some of the most visible guests are those who would make it so: they are the Western security men—British, American, typically tattooed, muscular, and short-haired—who at exorbitant cost have been hired by the big news organizations to protect their staffs. They sit around in the coffee shop drinking tea and chuckling over the antics of the reporters. As is well known, a few of those reporters spend their entire tours inside. This is not necessarily their fault: some of those who work for the large television networks, for instance, live under a house arrest so strict that they would violate it at the cost of their jobs. &quot;Live from Baghdad&quot; for them means live from the roof.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other extreme are the handful of freelancers still in town. They are photographers and writers, looking to break through to steadier jobs, and compelled to take risks that others do not—seeking out the insurgents, for instance, or getting themselves caught on the receiving end of American fire. They may be smart or not. They appear in the coffee shop, nod to their friends, and perhaps down a beer before disappearing to their rooms to shower and sleep. They are young. I know one who until coming to Baghdad had never been abroad. He told me that he had to struggle now against imagining that the entire world is like this. He had stopped by Europe recently, and had been struck by its similarity to the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the core reporters are different again. They work for newspapers and weekly magazines, pounding away on laptop computers against deadlines set by North American clocks, and trying to accommodate the requests of distant editors who have little sense of the realities here. The old hands among them got their starts in the Balkan wars a decade ago, but most of these people owe their careers to the attacks of September 11, 2001. They were city-desk reporters or the like, some quite junior, but they seized this opportunity to head to Afghanistan and the Middle East, and they became experienced fast. Some positioned themselves in Iraq before the war, and in at least one case suffered the consequences: a charming and quick-witted reporter for &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt; named Matthew McAllester, who remains in Baghdad today, was arrested for being a spy, and thrown into the Abu Ghraib prison; he was released just prior to the city's fall. Others came in with the American troops, bearing witness to the soldiers' success, however superficial they suspected it to be. Still others arrived later, and found themselves even more deeply at war. All of them have struggled ever since, within the confines of journalistic convention, at balancing official assertions of progress against the reality so obvious here: the systematic failure of America's policy in Iraq. They are at once earnest and cynical about their role. If they do not give weight to official interpretations of the news, or if they appear too bluntly to contradict them, they are quickly accused of bias—an assertion that from a distance people find all too easy to believe. Could things really be so bad in Iraq? The reporters are left with little choice but to scatter their observations and bury the counterpoints deep within their columns, trusting readers to move beyond the headlines and pick up the hints. The collective mood as a result has shifted from enthusiasm for the subject to quiet frustration and fatigue. Every reporter I know seems to have grown ambivalent about staying on in Iraq. Related to this are the practical limitations, which compared with those of any other assignment in memory have become severe: given the insecurity of the roads, the reporters can hardly leave the city unless they &quot;embed&quot; themselves within the military (and write the corresponding stories), and even in Baghdad they can move only at great risk, and almost never on foot. This leads to another accusation—that they are engaged in &quot;hotel journalism,&quot; and might as well be writing from the comforts of the Four Seasons in Amman. They themselves agonize over the restraints they face. But the truth is that they are by no means prisoners of this place, and they rarely stay inside the Hamra for even one full day; despite the risks, most of them continue to explore and to learn, to cultivate good sources, and to maintain a close view of Iraq. If one can generalize about such a disparate group, they are ethical, energetic, and extraordinarily brave. Some are cultivated and obviously quite brilliant as well. Their readers are spoiled. The Hamra houses an impressive crowd.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suites aren't bad either. They are furnished brightly in a spare urban style reminiscent of that promoted by Ikea—a welcome relief from the heavy Arab furnishings and decorations of other establishments. The large news organizations occupy sets of suites, or entire floors, and their rotating crews tend to run roughshod over the interiors, strewing their computers and flak vests about, and not so much residing in their rooms as camping out. Individual reporters, however, have established real homes, complete with iPod stereos, small libraries, and well-supplied kitchens. Groups of reporters sometimes gather in these places for small dinner parties over mediocre wine but otherwise exquisite meals. They leave their cell phones on, and come and go as required by work, but during the lulls outside, when there is no noise of helicopters or fighting to be heard, they might almost be sitting in New York's Upper West Side. Their conversations range wide, but return predictably to the subject of Iraq. It is here that one can see the depth of their expertise and get a sense of the frustration they feel that so little of what they know finally emerges in print. Though they are friends, and some are lovers, they do not talk much in these groups about their personal lives. They do talk about security, hashing over the ever changing threats in specific detail, and discussing shifts in their tactics of self-defense. Some admit to being superstitious—to carrying lucky stones in their pockets, or refusing ever to light their cigarettes from candles. But the emotion they express is concern rather than fear. Only once have I seen the conversation falter—over a certain on-camera decapitation. The sound of explosions and firefights, on the other hand, scarcely merits their attention; recently at a dinner when a series of mortar rounds fell nearby, the conversation, which happened to be about coverage by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, did not miss a beat. Matthew McAllester may have noticed that I was amused. He smiled and said, &quot;Quite a jaded bunch.&quot; With irony and not the slightest trace of bluster, he admitted to his own disappointment with explosions less resonant than those of the biggest car bombs. This is the sort of statement that the superstitious should not make. But after a year of visits to Iraq, I knew what he meant. If you're going to do it, at least do it right.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at the Flowers Land the war feels closer to home, and even the small explosions may merit comment. My suite is on the second floor, on the back side of the building, which is poorly protected. The sitting room is narrow. It is overfurnished with two threadbare easy chairs, a matching threadbare sofa, and a coffee table that seems to have been dragged in from the streets. It has a small desk with a chair. It has a TV. I sit here among Iraqi friends, with weapons scattered about. At the far end of the room is a sliding glass door, taped with an X to mitigate shattering. The framing is flimsy, and rattles from mortar rounds even a half mile away. For larger explosions we go outside to check for smoke, and to watch the helicopters swarming around. The door gives onto a small balcony overlooking a large dirt lot heavily strewn with garbage. A pack of feral dogs lives below the balcony, among the weeds. They are large and yellow, and include a litter of yelping puppies who play and tumble around. When people approach, the adult dogs raise their hackles and snarl threateningly. They retreat when rocks are thrown, but their presence comforts me anyway, because of the chance they might alert us to intruders. Beyond the lot and to one side stands a windowless bunker said to have been built by the French to withstand a nuclear attack. The bunker has a concrete mushroom top, and extends several levels below ground. Currently it houses the minister of the interior, whose family is believed to be safely abroad. It is protected by machine gunners in booths attached high on walls, and by loose groups of ill-disciplined Iraqi police, who mill around on the dirt out beyond the dogs. Their presence does not reassure me, because they are as likely as not to fire on us if we ever have to jump from the balcony, and they get especially edgy once the sun goes down. Recently after curfew they opened fire furiously at something real or imagined across the lot—I never found out what. This was the second time in three nights, and they did not let up. We extinguished our lights and hit the floor. An Iraqi friend went squirming out onto the balcony with his Kalashnikov, though no rounds were coming through the glass, and it seemed obvious that we ourselves were not (yet) under attack. I pulled on his ankle, and got him to come back inside. It was a diverting few minutes. But the nights at the Flowers Land are usually slow. We keep the curtains drawn, and eat takeout chicken, hummus, and flatbread. Sometimes we watch movies on TV. My friend calls himself Van Damme, after the action hero. He wears wraparound sunglasses. He is good with a gun. He performs a pistol trick, cycling the fifteen rounds through the chamber of a Beretta and catching each ejected bullet in midair. He times himself and tries to beat his record. When he tires of that, he plays a shooting game on his cell phone. I work on notes and read. Sometimes we watch Lebanese music videos to see the women dance. On the wall above my desk hangs a painting of a reclining maiden gazing into a hand mirror that she holds overhead. I gaze at her too, but do not find her as attractive as she seems to find herself. This may change. The hotels of Baghdad are not prisons, but they do provide time to ponder such things.

        <ALLTEXT>The Road
&lt;p class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he'd
reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. Nights dark beyond
darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before.
Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world. His hand
rose and fell softly with each precious breath. He pushed away the
plastic tarpaulin and raised himself in the stinking robes and blankets
and looked toward the east for any light but there was none. In the
dream from which he'd wakened he had wandered in a cave where the child
led him by the hand. Their light playing over the wet flowstone walls.
Like pilgrims in a fable swallowed up and lost among the inward parts
of some granitic beast. Deep stone flues where the water dripped and
sang. Tolling in the silence the minutes of the earth and the hours and
the days of it and the years without cease. Until they stood in a great
stone room where lay a black and ancient lake. And on the far shore a
creature that raised its dripping mouth from the rimstone pool and
stared into the light with eyes dead white and sightless as the eggs of
spiders. It swung its head low over the water as if to take the scent
of what it could not see. Crouching there pale and naked and
translucent, its alabaster bones cast up in shadow on the rocks behind
it. Its bowels, its beating heart. The brain that pulsed in a dull
glass bell. It swung its head from side to side and then gave out a low
moan and turned and lurched away and loped soundlessly into the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the first gray light he rose and left the boy sleeping and walked
out to the road and squatted and studied the country to the south.
Barren, silent, godless. He thought the month was October but he wasnt
sure. He hadn't kept a calendar for years. They were moving south.
There'd be no surviving another winter here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it was light enough to use the binoculars he glassed the valley
below. Everything paling away into the murk. The soft ash blowing in
loose swirls over the blacktop. He studied what he could see. The
segments of road down there among the dead trees. Looking for anything
of color. Any movement. Any trace of standing smoke. He lowered the
glasses and pulled down the cotton mask from his face and wiped his
nose on the back of his wrist and then glassed the country again. Then
he just sat there holding the binoculars and watching the ashen
daylight congeal over the land. He knew only that the child was his
warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When he got back the boy was still asleep. He pulled the blue plastic
tarp off of him and folded it and carried it out to the grocery cart
and packed it and came back with their plates and some cornmeal cakes
in a plastic bag and a plastic bottle of syrup. He spread the small
tarp they used for a table on the ground and laid everything out and he
took the pistol from his belt and laid it on the cloth and then he just
sat watching the boy sleep. He'd pulled away his mask in the night and
it was buried somewhere in the blankets. He watched the boy and he
looked out through the trees toward the road. This was not a safe
place. They could be seen from the road now it was day. The boy turned
in the blankets. Then he opened his eyes. Hi, Papa, he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I'm right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An hour later they were on the road. He pushed the cart and both he and
the boy carried knapsacks. In the knapsacks were essential things. In
case they had to abandon the cart and make a run for it. Clamped to the
handle of the cart was a chrome motorcycle mirror that he used to watch
the road behind them. He shifted the pack higher on his shoulders and
looked out over the wasted country. The road was empty. Below in the
little valley the still gray serpentine of a river. Motionless and
precise. Along the shore a burden of dead reeds. Are you okay? he said.
The boy nodded. Then they set out along the blacktop in the gunmetal
light, shuffling through the ash, each the other's world entire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They crossed the river by an old concrete bridge and a few miles on
they came upon a roadside gas station. They stood in the road and
studied it. I think we should check it out, the man said. Take a look.
The weeds they forded fell to dust about them. They crossed the broken
asphalt apron and found the tank for the pumps. The cap was gone and
the man dropped to his elbows to smell the pipe but the odor of gas was
only a rumor, faint and stale. He stood and looked over the building.
The pumps standing with their hoses oddly still in place. The windows
intact. The door to the service bay was open and he went in. A standing
metal toolbox against one wall. He went through the drawers but there
was nothing there that he could use. Good half-inch drive sockets. A
ratchet. He stood looking around the garage. A metal barrel full of
trash. He went into the office. Dust and ash everywhere. The boy stood
in the door. A metal desk, a cash register. Some old automotive
manuals, swollen and sodden. The linoleum was stained and curling from
the leaking roof. He crossed to the desk and stood there. Then he
picked up the phone and dialed the number of his father's house in that
long ago. The boy watched him. What are you doing? he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A quarter mile down the road he stopped and looked back. We're not
thinking, he said. We have to go back. He pushed the cart off the road
and tilted it over where it could not be seen and they left their packs
and went back to the station. In the service bay he dragged out the
steel trash drum and tipped it over and pawed out all the quart plastic
oil bottles. Then they sat in the floor decanting them of their dregs
one by one, leaving the bottles to stand upside down draining into a
pan until at the end they had almost a half quart of motor oil. He
screwed down the plastic cap and wiped the bottle off with a rag and
hefted it in his hand. Oil for their little slutlamp to light the long
gray dusks, the long gray dawns. You can read me a story, the boy said.
Cant you, Papa? Yes, he said. I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the far side of the river valley the road passed through a stark
black burn. Charred and limbless trunks of trees stretching away on
every side. Ash moving over the road and the sagging hands of blind
wire strung from the blackened lightpoles whining thinly in the wind. A
burned house in a clearing and beyond that a reach of meadowlands stark
and gray and a raw red mudbank where a roadworks lay abandoned. Farther
along were billboards advertising motels. Everything as it once had
been save faded and weathered. At the top of the hill they stood in the
cold and the wind, getting their breath. He looked at the boy. I'm all
right, the boy said. The man put his hand on his shoulder and nodded
toward the open country below them. He got the binoculars out of the
cart and stood in the road and glassed the plain down there where the
shape of a city stood in the grayness like a charcoal drawing sketched
across the waste. Nothing to see. No smoke. Can I see? the boy said.
Yes. Of course you can. The boy leaned on the cart and adjusted the
wheel. What do you see? the man said. Nothing. He lowered the glasses.
It's raining. Yes, the man said. I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They left the cart in a gully covered with the tarp and made their way
up the slope through the dark poles of the standing trees to where he'd
seen a running ledge of rock and they sat under the rock overhang and
watched the gray sheets of rain blow across the valley. It was very
cold. They sat huddled together wrapped each in a blanket over their
coats and after a while the rain stopped and there was just the
dripping in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it had cleared they went down to the cart and pulled away the tarp
and got their blankets and the things they would need for the night.
They went back up the hill and made their camp in the dry dirt under
the rocks and the man sat with his arms around the boy trying to warm
him. Wrapped in the blankets, watching the nameless dark come to
enshroud them. The gray shape of the city vanished in the night's onset
like an apparition and he lit the little lamp and set it back out of
the wind. Then they walked out to the road and he took the boy's hand
and they went to the top of the hill where the road crested and where
they could see out over the darkening country to the south, standing
there in the wind, wrapped in their blankets, watching for any sign of
a fire or a lamp. There was nothing. The lamp in the rocks on the side
of the hill was little more than a mote of light and after a while they
walked back. Everything too wet to make a fire. They ate their poor
meal cold and lay down in their bedding with the lamp between them.
He'd brought the boy's book but the boy was too tired for reading. Can
we leave the lamp on till I'm asleep? he said. Yes. Of course we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He was a long time going to sleep. After a while he turned and looked
at the man. His face in the small light streaked with black from the
rain like some old world thespian. Can I ask you something? he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes. Of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we going to die?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sometime. Not now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And we're still going south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

So we'll be warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Okay what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Nothing. Just okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I'm going to blow out the lamp. Is that okay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes. That's okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And then later in the darkness: Can I ask you something?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes. Of course you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What would you do if I died?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If you died I would want to die too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

So you could be with me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes. So I could be with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He lay listening to the water drip in the woods. Bedrock, this. The
cold and the silence. The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak
and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered
and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring.
Unsupported in the ashen air. Sustained by a breath, trembling and
brief. If only my heart were stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He woke before dawn and watched the gray day break. Slow and half
opaque. He rose while the boy slept and pulled on his shoes and wrapped
in his blanket he walked out through the trees. He descended into a
gryke in the stone and there he crouched coughing and he coughed for a
long time. Then he just knelt in the ashes. He raised his face to the
paling day. Are you there? he whispered. Will I see you at the last?
Have you a neck by which to throttle you? Have you a heart? Damn you
eternally have you a soul? Oh God, he whispered. Oh God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They passed through the city at noon of the day following. He kept the
pistol to hand on the folded tarp on top of the cart. He kept the boy
close to his side. The city was mostly burned. No sign of life. Cars in
the street caked with ash, everything covered with ash and dust. Fossil
tracks in the dried sludge. A corpse in a doorway dried to leather.
Grimacing at the day. He pulled the boy closer. Just remember that the
things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might
want to think about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You forget some things, don't you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was a lake a mile from his uncle's farm where he and his uncle
used to go in the fall for firewood. He sat in the back of the rowboat
trailing his hand in the cold wake while his uncle bent to the oars.
The old man's feet in their black kid shoes braced against the
uprights. His straw hat. His cob pipe in his teeth and a thin drool
swinging from the pipebowl. He turned to take a sight on the far shore,
cradling the oar handles, taking the pipe from his mouth to wipe his
chin with the back of his hand. The shore was lined with birchtrees
that stood bone pale against the dark of the evergreens beyond. The
edge of the lake a riprap of twisted stumps, gray and weathered, the
windfall trees of a hurricane years past. The trees themselves had long
been sawed for firewood and carried away. His uncle turned the boat and
shipped the oars and they drifted over the sandy shallows until the
transom grated in the sand. A dead perch lolling belly up in the clear
water. Yellow leaves. They left their shoes on the warm painted boards
and dragged the boat up onto the beach and set out the anchor at the
end of its rope. A lard can poured with concrete with an eyebolt in the
center. They walked along the shore while his uncle studied the tree
stumps, puffing at his pipe, a manila rope coiled over his shoulder. He
picked one out and they turned it over, using the roots for leverage,
until they got it half floating in the water. Trousers rolled to the
knee but still they got wet. They tied the rope to a cleat at the rear
of the boat and rowed back across the lake, jerking the stump slowly
behind them. By then it was already evening. Just the slow periodic
rack and shuffle of the oarlocks. The lake dark glass and window lights
coming on along the shore. A radio somewhere. Neither of them had
spoken a word. This was the perfect day of his childhood. This the day
to shape the days upon.

        <SUMMARY>A great essay by Scott Russell Sanders.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>Source: HARPER'S, Nov. 1989, pp. 68-75

My father drank. He drank as a gut-punched boxer gasps for breath, as a starving dog gobbles food--compulsively, secretly, in pain and trembling. I use the past tense not because he ever quit drinking but because he quit living. That is how the story ends for my father, age sixty-four, heart bursting, body cooling, slumped and forsaken on the linoleum of my brother's trailer. The story continues for my brother, my sister, my mother, and me, and will continue as long as memory holds.

In the perennial present of memory, I slip into the garage or barn to see my father tipping back the flat green bottles of wine, the brown cylinders of whiskey, the cans of beer disguised in paper bags. His Adam's apple bobs, the liquid gurgles, he wipes the sandy-haired back of a hand over his lips, and then, his bloodshot gaze bumping into me, he stashes the bottle or can inside his jacket, under the workbench, between two bales of hay, and we both pretend the moment has not occurred.

&quot;What's up, buddy?&quot; he says, thick-tongued and edgy.

&quot;Sky's up,&quot; I answer, playing along.

&quot;And don't forget prices,&quot; he grumbles. &quot;Prices are always up. And taxes.&quot;

In memory, his white 1951 Pontiac with the stripes down the hood and the Indian head on the snout lurches to a stop in the driveway; or it is the 1956 Ford station wagon, or the 1963 Rambler shaped like a toad, or the sleek 1969 Bonneville that will do 120 miles per hour on straightaways; or it is the robin's-egg-blue pickup, new in 1980, battered in 1981, the year of his death. He climbs out, grinning dangerously, unsteady on his legs, and we children interrupt our game of catch, our building of snow forts, our picking of plums, to watch in silence as he weaves past us into the house, where he drops into his overstuffed chair and falls asleep. Shaking her head, our mother stubs out a cigarette he has left smoldering in the ashtray. All evening, until our bedtimes, we tiptoe past him, as past a snoring dragon. Then we curl fearfully in our sheets, listening. Eventually he wakes with a grunt, Mother slings accusations at him, he snarls back, she yells, he growls, their voices clashing. Before long, she retreats to their bedroom, sobbing--not from the blows of fists, for he never strikes her, but from the force of his words.

Left alone, our father prowls the house, thumping into furniture, rummaging in the kitchen, slamming doors, turning the pages of the newspaper with a savage crackle, muttering back at the late-night drivel from television. The roof might fly off, the walls might buckle from the pressure of his rage. Whatever my brother and sister and mother may be thinking on their own rumpled pillows, I lie there hating him, loving him, fearing him, knowing I have failed him. I tell myself he drinks to ease the ache that gnaws at his belly, an ache I must have caused by disappointing him somehow, a murderous ache I should be able to relieve by doing all my chores, earning A's in school, winning baseball games, fixing the broken washer and the burst pipes, bringing in the money to fill his empty wallet. He would not hide the green bottles in his toolbox, would not sneak off to the barn with a lump under his coat, would not fall asleep in the daylight, would not roar and fume, would not drink himself to death, if only I were perfect.

I am forty-four, and I know full well now that my father was an alcoholic, a man consumed by disease rather than by disappointment. What had seemed to me a private grief is in fact, of course, a public scourge. In the United States alone, some ten or fifteen million people share his ailment, and behind the doors they slam in fury or disgrace, countless other children tremble. I comfort myself with such knowledge, holding it against the throb of memory like an ice pack against a bruise. Other people have keener sources of grief - poverty, racism, rape, war. I do not wish to compete to determine who has suffered most. I am only trying to understand the corrosive mixture of helplessness, responsibility, and shame that I learned to feel as the son of an alcoholic. I realize now that I did not cause my father's illness, nor could I have cured it. Yet for all this grownup knowledge, I am still ten years old, my own son's age, and as that boy I struggle in guilt and confusion to save my father from pain.

Consider a few of our synonyms for drunk: tipsy, tight, pickled, soused, and plowed; stoned and stewed, lubricated and inebriated, juiced and sluiced; three sheets to the wind, in your cups, out of your mind, under the table; lit up, tanked up, wiped out; besotted, blotto, bombed, and buzzed; plastered, polluted, putrefied; loaded or looped, boozy, woozy, fuddled, or smashed; crocked and shit-faced, corked and pissed, snockered and sloshed. 

It is a mostly humorous lexicon, as the lore that deals with drunks--in jokes and cartoons, in plays, films, and television skits--is largely comic. Aunt Matilda nips elderberry wine from the sideboard and burps politely during supper. Uncle Fred slouches to the table glassy-eyed, wearing a lampshade for a hat and murmuring, &quot;Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.&quot; Inspired by cocktails, Mrs. Somebody recounts the events of her day in a fuzzy dialect, while Mr. Somebody nibbles her ear and croons a bawdy song. On the sofa with Boyfriend, Daughter Somebody giggles, licking gin from her lips, and loosens the bows in her hair. Junior knocks back some brews with his chums at the Leopard Lounge and stumbles home to the wrong house, wonders foggily why he cannot locate his pajamas, and crawls naked into bed with the ugliest girl in school. The family dog slurps from a neglected martini and wobbles to the nursery, where he vomits in Baby's shoe.

It is all great fun. But if in the audience you notice a few laughing faces turn grim when the drunk lurches onstage, don't be surprised, for these are the children of alcoholics. Over the grinning mask of Dionysus, the leering face of Bacchus, these children cannot help seeing the bloated features of their own parents. Instead of laughing, they wince, they mourn. Instead of celebrating the drunk as one freed from constraints, they pity him as one enslaved. They refuse to believe &quot;in vino veritas&quot;, having seen their befuddled parents skid away from truth toward folly and oblivion. And so these children bite their lips until the lush staggers into the wings.

My father, when drunk, was neither funny nor honest; he was pathetic, frightening, deceitful. There seemed to be a leak in him somewhere, and he poured in booze to keep from draining dry. Like a torture victim who refuses to squeal, he would never admit that he had touched a drop, not even in his last year, when he seemed to be dissolving in alcohol before our very eyes. I never knew him to lie about anything, ever, except about this one ruinous fact. Drowsy, clumsy, unable to fix a bicycle tire, balance a grocery sack, or walk across a room, he was stripped of his true self by drink. In a matter of minutes, the contents of a bottle could transform a brave man into a coward, a buddy into a bully, a gifted athlete and skilled carpenter and shrewd businessman into a bumbler. No dictionary of synonyms for drunk would soften the anguish of watching our prince turn into a frog. 

Father's drinking became the family secret. While growing up, we children never breathed a word of it beyond the four walls of our house. To this day, my brother and sister rarely mention it, and then only when I press them. I did not confess the ugly, bewildering fact to my wife until his wavering and slurred speech forced me to. Recently, on the seventh anniversary of my father's death, I asked my mother if she ever spoke of his drinking to friends. &quot;No, no, never,&quot; she replied hastily. &quot;I couldn't bear for anyone to know.&quot;

The secret bores under the skin, gets in the blood, into the bone, and stays there. Long after you have supposedly been cured of malaria, the fever can flare up, the tremors can shake you. So it is with the fevers of shame. You swallow the bitter quinine of knowledge, and you learn to feel pity and compassion toward the drinker. Yet the shame lingers and, because of it, anger.

For a long stretch of my childhood we lived on a military reservation in Ohio, an arsenal where bombs were stored underground in bunkers and vintage airplanes burst into flames and unstable artillery shells boomed nightly at the dump. We had the feeling, as children, that we played within a minefield, where a heedless footfall could trigger an explosion. When Father was drinking, the house, too, became a minefield. The least bump could set off either parent.

The more he drank, the more obsessed Mother became with stopping him. She hunted for bottles, counted the cash in his wallet, sniffed at his breath. Without meaning to snoop, we children blundered left and right into damning evidence. On afternoons when he came home from work sober, we flung ourselves at him for hugs and felt against our ribs the telltale lump in his coat. In the barn we tumbled on the hay and heard beneath our sneakers the crunch of broken glass. We tugged open a drawer in his workbench, looking for screwdrivers or crescent wrenches, and spied a gleaming six-pack among the tools. Playing tag, we darted around the house just in time to see him sway on the rear stoop and heave a finished bottle into the woods. In his goodnight kiss we smelled the cloying sweetness of Clorets, the mints he chewed to camouflage his dragon's breath.

I can summon up that kiss right now by recalling Theodore Roethke's lines about his own father:

The whiskey on your breath Could make a small boy dizzy; But I hung on like death: Such waltzing was not easy.

Such waltzing was hard, terribly hard, for with a boy's scrawny arms I was trying to hold my tipsy father upright.

For years, the chief source of those incriminating bottles and cans was a grimy store a mile from us, a cinderblock place called Sly's, with two gas pumps outside and a mangy dog asleep in the window. Inside, on rusty metal shelves or in wheezing coolers, you could find pop and Popsicles, cigarettes, potato chips, canned soup, raunchy postcards, fishing gear, Twinkies, wine, and beer. When Father drove anywhere on errands, Mother would send us along as guards, warning us not to let him out of our sight. And so with one or more of us on board, Father would cruise up to Sly's, pump a dollar's worth of gas or plump the tires with air, and then, telling us to wait in the car, he would head for the doorway.

Dutiful and panicky, we cried, &quot;Let us go with you!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he answered. &quot;I'll be back in two shakes.&quot;

&quot;Please!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; he roared. &quot;Don't you budge or I'll jerk a knot in your tails!&quot;

So we stayed put, kicking the seats, while he ducked inside. Often, when he had parked the car at a careless angle, we gazed in through the window and saw Mr. Sly fetching down from the shelf behind the cash register two green pints of Gallo wine. Father swigged one of them right there at the counter, stuffed the other in his pocket, and then out he came, a bulge in his coat, a flustered look on his reddened face. 

Because the mom and pop who ran the dump were neighbors of ours, living just down the tar-blistered road, I hated them all the more for poisoning my father. I wanted to sneak in their store and smash the bottles and set fire to the place. I also hated the Gallo brothers, Ernest and Julio, whose jovial faces beamed from the labels of their wine, labels I would find, torn and curled, when I burned the trash. I noted the Gallo brothers' address in California and studied the road atlas to see how far that was from Ohio, because I meant to go out there and tell Ernest and Julio what they were doing to my father, and then, if they showed no mercy, I would kill them.

While growing up on the back roads and in the country schools and cramped Methodist churches of Ohio and Tennessee, I never heard the word alcoholic, never happened across it in books or magazines. In the nearby towns, there were no addiction-treatment programs, no community mental-health centers, no Alcoholics Anonymous chapters, no therapists. Left alone with our grievous secret, we had no way of understanding Father's drinking except as an act of will, a deliberate folly or cruelty, a moral weakness, a sin. He drank because he chose to, pure and simple. Why our father, so playful and competent and kind when sober, would choose to ruin himself and punish his family we could not fathom.

Our neighborhood was high on the Bible, and the Bible was hard on drunkards. &quot;Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and valiant men in mixing strong drink,&quot; wrote Isaiah. &quot;The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, they are confused with wine, they err in vision, they stumble in giving judgment. For all tables are full of vomit, no place is without filthiness.&quot; We children had seen those fouled tables at the local truckstop where the notorious boozers hung out, our father occasionally among them. &quot;Wine and new wine take away the understanding,&quot; declared the prophet Hosea. We had also seen evidence of that in our father, who could multiply seven-digit numbers in his head when sober but when drunk could not help us with fourth-grade math. Proverbs warned: &quot;Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. At the last it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind utter perverse things.&quot; Woe, woe.

Dismayingly often, these biblical drunkards stirred up trouble for their own kids. Noah made fresh wine after the flood, drank too much of it, fell asleep without any clothes on, and was glimpsed in the buff by his son Ham, whom Noah promptly cursed. In one passage--it was so shocking we had to read it under our blankets with flashlights--the patriarch Lot fell down drunk and slept with his daughters. The sins of the fathers set their children's teeth on edge.

Our ministers were fond of quoting St. Paul's pronouncement that drunkards would not inherit the kingdom of God. These grave preachers assured us that the wine referred to in the Last Supper was in fact grape juice. Bible and sermons and hymns combined to give us the impression that Moses should have brought down from the mountain another stone tablet, bearing the Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not drink.

The scariest and most illuminating Bible story apropos of drunkards was the one about the lunatic and the swine. We knew it by heart: When Jesus climbed out of his boat one day, this lunatic came charging up from the graveyard, stark naked and filthy, frothing at the mouth, so violent that he broke the strongest chains. Nobody would go near him. Night and day for years, this madman had been wailing among the tombs and bruising himself with stones. Jesus took one look at him and said, &quot;Come out of the man, you unclean spirits!&quot; for he could see that the lunatic was possessed by demons. Meanwhile, some hogs were conveniently rooting nearby. &quot;If we have to come out,&quot; begged the demons, &quot;at least let us go into those swine.&quot; Jesus agreed, the unclean spirits entered the hogs, and the hogs raced straight off a cliff and plunged into a lake. Hearing the story in Sunday school, my friends thought mainly of the pigs. (How big a splash did they make? Who paid for the lost pork?) But I thought of the redeemed lunatic, who bathed himself and put on clothes and calmly sat at the feet of Jesus, restored--so the Bible said--to &quot;his right mind.&quot;

When drunk, our father was clearly in his wrong mind. He became a stranger, as fearful to us as any graveyard lunatic, not quite frothing at the mouth but fierce enough, quick-tempered, explosive; or else he grew maudlin and weepy, which frightened us nearly as much. In my boyhood despair, I reasoned that maybe he wasn't to blame for turning into an ogre: Maybe, like the lunatic, he was possessed by demons.

If my father was indeed possessed, who would exorcise him? If he was a sinner, who would save him? If he was ill, who would cure him? If he suffered, who would ease his pain? Not ministers or doctors, for we could not bring ourselves to confide in them; not the neighbors, for we pretended they had never seen him drunk; not Mother, who fussed and pleaded but could not budge him; not my brother and sister, who were only kids. That left me. It did not matter that I, too, was only a child, and a bewildered one at that. I could not excuse myself.

On first reading a description of delirium tremens--in a book on alcoholism I smuggled from a university library--I thought immediately of the frothing lunatic and the frenzied swine. When I read stories or watched films about grisly metamorphoses--Dr. Jekyll becoming Mr. Hyde, the mild husband changing into a werewolf, the kindly neighbor inhabited by a brutal alien--I could not help but see my own father's mutation from sober to drunk. Even today, knowing better, I am attracted by the demonic theory of drink, for when I recall my father's transformation, the emergence of his ugly second self, I find it easy to believe in being possessed by unclean spirits. We never knew which version of Father would come home from work, the true or the tainted, nor could we guess how far down the slope toward cruelty he would slide. 

How far a man could slide we gauged by observing our back-road neighbors--the out-of-work miners who had dragged their families to our corner of Ohio from the desolate hollows of Appalachia, the tightfisted farmers, the surly mechanics, the balked and broken men. There was, for example, whiskey-soaked Mr. Jenkins, who beat his wife and kids so hard we could hear their screams from the road. There was Mr. Lavo the wino, who fell asleep smoking time and again, until one night his disgusted wife bundled up the children and went outside and left him in his easy chair to burn; he awoke on his own, staggered out coughing into the yard, and pounded her flat while the children looked on and the shack turned to ash. There was the truck driver, Mr. Sampson, who tripped over his son's tricycle one night while drunk and got mad, jumped into his semi, and drove away, shifting through the dozen gears, and never came back. We saw the bruised children of these fathers clump onto our school bus, we saw the abandoned children huddle in the pews at church, we saw the stunned and battered mothers begging for help at our doors.

Our own father never beat us, and I don't think he beat Mother, but he threatened often. The Old Testament Yahweh was not more terrible in His rage. Eyes blazing, voice booming, Father would pull out his belt and swear to give us a whipping, but he never followed through, never needed to, because we could imagine it so vividly. He shoved us, pawed us with the back of his hand, not to injure, just to clear a space. I can see him grabbing Mother by the hair as she cowers on a chair during a nightly quarrel. He twists her neck back until she gapes up at him, and then he lifts over her skull a glass quart bottle of milk, the milk spilling down his forearm, and he yells at her, &quot;Say just one more word, one goddamn word, and I'll shut you up!&quot; I fear she will prick him with her sharp tongue, but she is terrified into silence, and so am I, and the leaking bottle quivers in the air, and milk seeps through the red hair of my father's uplifted arm, and the entire scene is there to this moment, the head jerked back, the club raised.

When the drink made him weepy, Father would pack, kiss each of us children on the head, and announce from the front door that he was moving out. &quot;Where to?&quot; we demanded, fearful each time that he would leave for good, as Mr. Simpson had roared away for good in his diesel truck. &quot;Someplace where I won't get hounded every minute,&quot; Father would answer, his jaw quivering. He stabbed a look at Mother, who might say, &quot;Don't run into the ditch before you get there,&quot; or &quot;Good riddance,&quot; and then he would slink away. Mother watched him go with arms crossed over her chest, her face closed like the lid on a box of snakes. We children bawled. Where could he go? To the truck stop, that den of iniquity? To one of those dark, ratty flophouses in town? Would he wind up sleeping under a railroad bridge or on a park bench or in a cardboard box, mummied in rags like the bums we had seen on our trips to Cleveland and Chicago? We bawled and bawled, wondering if he would ever come back. He always did come back, a day or a week later, but each time there was a sliver less of him.

In Kafka's METAMORPHOSIS, which opens famously with Gregor Samsa waking up from uneasy dreams to find himself transformed into an insect, Gregor's family keep reassuring themselves that things will be just fine again &quot;when he comes back to us.&quot; Each time alcohol transformed our father we held out the same hope, that he would really and truly come back to us, our authentic father, the tender and playful and competent man, and then all things would be fine. We had grounds for such hope. After his tearful departures and chapfallen returns, he would sometimes go weeks, even months, without drinking. Those were glad times. Every day without the furtive glint of bottles, every meal without a fight, every bedtime without sobs encouraged us to believe that such bliss might go on forever. 

Mother was fooled by such a hope all during the forty-odd years she knew Greeley Ray Sanders. Soon after she met him in a Chicago delicatessen on the eve of World War II and fell for his butter-melting Mississippi drawl and his wavy red hair, she learned that he drank heavily. But then so did a lot of men. She would soon coax or scold him into breaking the nasty habit. She would point out to him how ugly and foolish it was, this bleary drinking, and then he would quit. He refused to quit during their engagement, however, still refused during the first years of marriage, refused until my older sister came along. The shock of fatherhood sobered him, and he remained sober through my birth at the end of the war and right on through until we moved in 1951 to the Ohio arsenal. The arsenal had more than its share of alcoholics, drug addicts, and other varieties of escape artists. There I turned six and started school and woke into a child's flickering awareness, just in time to see my father begin sneaking swigs in the garage.

He sobered up again for most of a year at the height of the Korean War, to celebrate the birth of my brother. But aside from that dry spell, his only breaks from drinking before I graduated from high school were just long enough to raise and then dash our hopes. Then during the fall of my senior year--the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it seemed that the nightly explosions at the munitions dump and the nightly rages in our household might spread to engulf the globe--Father collapsed. His liver, kidneys, and heart all conked out. The doctors saved him, but only by a hair. He stayed in the hospital for weeks, going through a withdrawal so terrible that Mother would not let us visit him. If he wanted to kill himself, the doctors solemnly warned him, all he had to do was hit the bottle again. One binge would finish him.

Father must have believed them, for he stayed dry the next fifteen years. It was an answer to prayer, Mother said, it was a miracle. I believe it was a reflex of fear, which he sustained over the years through courage and pride. He knew a man could die from drink, for his brother Roscoe had. We children never laid eyes on doomed Uncle Roscoe, but in the stories Mother told us he became a fairy-tale figure, like a boy who took the wrong turn in the woods and was gobbled up by the wolf.

The fifteen-year dry spell came to an end with Father's retirement in the spring of 1978. Like many men, he gave up his identity along with his job. One day he was a boss at the factory, with a brass plate on his door and a reputation to uphold; the next day he was a nobody at home. He and Mother were leaving Ontario, the last of the many places to which his job had carried them, and they were moving to a new house in Mississippi, his childhood stomping ground. As a boy in Mississippi, Father sold Coca-Cola during dances while the moonshiners peddled their brew in the parking lot; as a young blade, he fought in bars and in the ring, winning a state Golden Gloves championship; he gambled at poker, hunted pheasant, raced motorcycles and cars, played semiprofessional baseball, and, along with all his buddies--in the Black Cat Saloon, behind the cotton gin, in the woods--he drank hard. It was a perilous youth to dream of recovering.

After his final day of work, Mother drove on ahead with a car full of begonias and violets, while Father stayed behind to oversee the packing. When the van was loaded, the sweaty movers broke open a six-pack and offered him a beer. 

&quot;Let's drink to retirement!&quot; they crowed. &quot;Let's drink to freedom! to fishing! hunting! loafing! Let's drink to a guy who's going home!&quot;

At least I imagine some such words, for that is all I can do, imagine, and I see Father's hand trembling in midair as he thinks about the fifteen sober years and about the doctors' warning, and he tells himself, Goddamnit, I am a free man, and Why can't a free man drink one beer after a lifetime of hard work? and I see his arm reaching, his fingers closing, the can tilting to his lips. I even supply a label for the beer, a swaggering brand that promises on television to deliver the essence of life. I watch the amber liquid pour down his throat, the alcohol steal into his blood, the key turn in his brain.

Soon after my parents moved back to Father's treacherous stomping ground, my wife and I visited them in Mississippi with our four-year-old daughter. Mother had been too distraught to warn me about the return of the demons. So when I climbed out of the car that bright July morning and saw my father napping in the hammock, I felt uneasy, and when he lurched upright and blinked his bloodshot eyes and greeted us in a syrupy voice, I was hurled back into childhood.

&quot;What's the matter with Papaw?&quot; our daughter asked.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said. &quot;Nothing!&quot;

Like a child again, I pretended not to see him in his stupor, and behind my phony smile I grieved. On that visit and on the few that remained before his death, once again I found bottles in the workbench, bottles in the woods. Again his hands shook too much for him to run a saw, to make his precious miniature furniture, to drive straight down back roads. Again he wound up in the ditch, in the hospital, in jail, in the treatment center. Again he shouted and wept. Again he lied. &quot;I never touched a drop,&quot; he swore. &quot;Your mother's making it up.&quot;

I no longer fancied I could reason with the men whose names I found on the bottles--Jim Beam, Jack Daniel's--but I was able now to recall the cold statistics about alcoholism: ten million victims, fifteen million, twenty. And yet, in spite of my age, I reacted in the same blind way as I had in childhood, by vainly seeking to erase through my efforts whatever drove him to drink. I worked on their place twelve and sixteen hours a day, in the swelter of Mississippi summers, digging ditches, running electrical wires, planting trees, mowing grass, building sheds, as though what nagged at him was some list of chores, as though by taking his worries upon my shoulders I could redeem him. I was flung back into boyhood, acting as though my father would not drink himself to death if only I were perfect.

I failed of perfection; he succeeded in dying. To the end, he considered himself not sick but sinful. &quot;Do you want to kill yourself?&quot; I asked him. &quot;Why not?&quot; he answered. &quot;Why the hell not? What's there to save?&quot; To the end, he would not speak about his feelings, would not or could not give a name to the beast that was devouring him. 

In silence, he went rushing off the cliff. Unlike the biblical swine, however, he left behind a few of the demons to haunt his children. Life with him and the loss of him twisted us into shapes that will be familiar to other sons and daughters of alcoholics. My brother became a rebel, my sister retreated into shyness, I played the stalwart and dutiful son who would hold the family together. If my father was unstable, I would be a rock. If he squandered money on drink, I would pinch every penny. If he wept when drunk--and only when drunk--I would not let myself weep at all. If he roared at the Little League umpire for calling my pitches balls, I would throw nothing but strikes. Watching him flounder and rage, I came to dread the loss of control. I would go through life without making anyone mad. I vowed never to put in my mouth or veins any chemical that would banish my everyday self. I would never make a scene, never lash out at the ones I loved, never hurt a soul. Through hard work, relentless work, I would achieve something dazzling--in the classroom, on the basketball court, in the science lab, in the pages of books--and my achievement would distract the world's eyes from his humiliation. I would become a worthy sacrifice, and the smoke of my burning would please God.

It is far easier to recognize these twists in my character than to undo them. Work has become an addiction for me, as drink was an addiction for my father. Knowing this, my daughter gave me a placard for the wall: Workaholic. The labor is endless and futile, for I can no more redeem myself through work than I could redeem my father. I still panic in the face of other people's anger, because his drunken temper was so terrible. I shrink from causing sadness or disappointment even to strangers, as though I were still concealing the family shame. I still notice every twitch of emotion in those faces around me, having learned as a child to read the weather in faces, and I blame myself for their least pang of unhappiness or anger. In certain moods I blame myself for everything. Guilt burns like acid in my veins.

I am moved to write these pages now because my own son, at the age of ten, is taking on himself the griefs of the world, and in particular the griefs of his father. He tells me that when I am gripped by sadness, he feels responsible; he feels there must be something he can do to spring me from depression, to fix my life. And that crushing sense of responsibility is exactly what I felt at the age of ten in the face of my father's drinking. My son wonders if I, too, am possessed. I write, therefore, to drag into the light what eats at me--the fear, the guilt, the shame--so that my own children may he spared. 

I still shy away from nightclubs, from bars, from parties where the solvent is alcohol. My friends puzzle over this, but it is no more peculiar than for a man to shy away from the lions' den after seeing his father torn apart. I took my own first drink at the age of twenty-one, half a glass of burgundy. I knew the odds of my becoming an alcoholic were four times higher than for the children of nonalcoholic fathers. So I sipped warily.

I still do--once a week, perhaps, a glass of wine, a can of beer, nothing stronger, nothing more. I listen for the turning of a key in my brain.</ALLTEXT>

        <ALLTEXT>Writing is an odd activity: there are no predefined steps, no firm rules, no obvious means of increasing skill. Except one: practice. I have been reviewing the items from the past few weeks, and it seems to me that you have now received many tips and suggestions for practice -- though I include several more this week, just in case you need help with various aspects of your upcoming assignment. So, at this point, you know what you are supposed to do: write.

Other than the suggested language and composition readings posted in this week's online schedule, I'm not going to post any new content for the next few days. Rather, I want to give you the freedom and the time to focus on your first project in the manner that seems best suited to you. At this stage, your project might involve reading, distillation, focus, or synthesis. Your effort this week should be targeted toward whatever is likely to be most useful to you. As you work, feel free to post thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or queries. I will respond to these as they are posted.</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY> A suite of suggestions...</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the project due at the end of this week, here are a few suggestions from me about various aspects of composition (you may have seen these before, or versions of these before... if you've been reading all of the suggested content for the course). If you get stuck, drop me a line. Otherwise, a writer writes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest and greatest poems, epics, and songs -- the original roots and branches of all literature -- are articulated visions. They are dreams, glimpses of other worlds (real or imagined), archetypes of clear seeing. This clarity of vision defines good literature, and is therefore the ultimate aim of practicing writers. Yet various impediments arise to obscure our sight, the way a bank of low-lying cloud hides a shoreline glistening with pebbles. As writers, sometimes we become disoriented by the many conflicting tools of our craft, by contrary examples and advice, by the spinning compasses of style and voice. Our path becomes uncertain, the shore distant, vision muddied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet the shore is not far, and reaching it requires only a steadfast purpose; and, of course, awareness of the fog. To dispel that fog we must avoid its common traps, which are our own habits in disguise. Below are the most common. Find them in your work, excise them, clear your vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 1: Use concrete imagery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer is a ruminative animal (like a cow, in fact). We chew over our lives and histories, we digest and express the stories to which we are drawn. This process requires a good deal of thought. Writers think -- cogitate, speculate, perambulate -- and we write down our thoughts. Yet we forget, often, that the reader does not have access to our mind, does not perceive the interconnections and contexts which lead us to our conclusions. We must show the reader that context, the web of threads and images by which we derive our narratives. And this requires that we replace our inner ruminations with concrete imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, unaccompanied by imagery, &lt;code&gt;I am sad&lt;/code&gt; is poor writing. The reader is offered no means by which to understand the cause or nature of the sadness. The writer must provide the path to understanding by way of imagery. Typically, the rule for this situation involves four or five concrete images for each internal rumination. Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Sheets of rain strike the window. I gaze into the dark, looking for but not finding the glimmer of proud trees across the field. Too dark to see anything. The house, empty now, twists and groans in the sidelong wind. Every whisper of its movement reminds me of the long, sad night ahead.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above passage, &lt;code&gt;sad&lt;/code&gt; is embedded within imagery, layered, integrated. It is not a rumination but a concrete indication of feeling. And it comes in the last of five sentences, thus proving the rule. This rule also has another name: Show, Don't Tell.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Tip 2: Use the present tense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when writing about the past, the present tense is usually the best route to clarity. Other tenses and moods require more words, encourage abstraction, and introduce a barrier between the immediacy of the reader and the distance of the text. These problems are most evident when writers use the subjunctive mood (or tense), which is defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Subjunctive: a mood that represent an act or state (not as a fact but) as contingent or possible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, the subjunctive mood uses words such as &lt;code&gt;if, that, though, lest, unless, except, until&lt;/code&gt; and so on. But in a more general way, the subjunctive mood, or tense, might be described as any writing that removes the reader from the concrete and present tense:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;I wish my dog were here.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;If Dave were stronger, he would have been able to lift the tree stump.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;If I had paid more attention to my instructor's tips about creative writing, I would be a better writer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;I requested that John be present at the wedding.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above examples illustrate various ways in which subjunctive approaches to writing introduce extra words and awkward phrases. Replacing these with concrete phrases in the present tense improves the writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;My dog is here.&lt;br /&gt;
Dave is not strong enough the lift the stump.&lt;br /&gt;
I listen to my creative writing instructor. My writing improves.&lt;br/&gt;
John comes to the wedding.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short list of words and phrases that often accompany writing that meanders away from the present tense and from concrete imagery. Avoid these words and phrases whenever possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
there&lt;br /&gt;
were&lt;br /&gt;
would&lt;br /&gt;
could&lt;br /&gt;
were/was&lt;br /&gt;
has/had&lt;br /&gt;
even&lt;br /&gt;
those/these&lt;br /&gt;
that/this&lt;br /&gt;
since&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Tip 3: Avoid adverbs and gerunds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gerund is a noun formed from a verb: &lt;code&gt;walking&lt;/code&gt;, for example. Gerunds usually end in &lt;code&gt;ing&lt;/code&gt;, and avoiding them is one of the single most positive changes a writer can make. Gerunds are problematic for two reasons: they encourage adverbs and they drift toward abstraction (see tips one and two).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a writer may describe a scene of walking as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;I was walking down the street, quickly, not paying too much attention to the hurtling traffic and the shop-keepers shouting stridently from their stalls.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vignette is neither in the present tense -- and is therefore less concrete than it might be -- nor is it crisp and clear enough. As soon as the writer begins with the gerund &lt;code&gt;walking&lt;/code&gt;, all the other adverbs and gerunds in the sentence follow naturally; awkwardly and naturally. Gerunds, therefore, imply adverbs and abstraction. Also, gerunds require more words and tenses: &lt;code&gt;was walking&lt;/code&gt; requires two words to state a simple verb. Here's how to reduce the confusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;I walk down the street. My steps are quick, my attention wanders. I do not notice the hurtling traffic, nor the shouts of strident shop-keepers as I pass their stalls.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised passage is more immediate, possesses an air of expectation (of suspense, almost), is constructed with precision, and contains no extra words. The revision begins with a present tense action: &lt;code&gt;I walk down the street&lt;/code&gt;. The remainder of the passage builds naturally, preserves the original clarity. Better. Stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gerunds, adverbs -- typically, words that end in &lt;code&gt;ly&lt;/code&gt; -- introduce abstraction and encourage awkward phrasings. An adverb qualifies a verb, limits or augments the verbal meaning. As such, an adverb serves the same function as a bank of fog laid across a shoreline. The fog obscures, mediates, filters. Almost always, adverbs may be replaced with more accurate verbs and fewer words; as in the example above, with the adverb &lt;code&gt;quickly&lt;/code&gt; replaced by the verb &lt;code&gt;quick&lt;/code&gt; and a concrete image of the steps of the walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerunds and adverbs are not always avoidable. They are necessary at times, and need not be shunned entirely. But they are lazy solutions. Avoid them whenever feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 4: Tune your vocabulary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is not speech. And yet the habits of speech tend to infiltrate writing. Resist this whenever possible: look for these infiltrations, replace them with narrative structures, preserve the clarity of your vision. For example, &lt;code&gt;I am not a farmer, and I do not eat broccoli&lt;/code&gt; is better than &lt;code&gt;I'm not a farmer, and I don't eat broccoli&lt;/code&gt;. Apostrophes derive from speech, and are usually to be avoided in writing (except in the case of possessives, obviously). In similar fashion, it is best to limit the use, in writing, of the following common and conversational words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
really&lt;br /&gt;
very&lt;br /&gt;
it&lt;br /&gt;
quite&lt;br /&gt;
real&lt;br /&gt;
some&lt;br /&gt;
somehow&lt;br /&gt;
someone&lt;br /&gt;
something&lt;br /&gt;
everything&lt;br /&gt;
thing&lt;br /&gt;
anyone&lt;br /&gt;
maybe&lt;br /&gt;
little&lt;br /&gt;
been&lt;br /&gt;
your&lt;br /&gt;
never&lt;br /&gt;
always&lt;br /&gt;
only&lt;br /&gt;
just&lt;br /&gt;
deep&lt;br /&gt;
people&lt;br /&gt;
about&lt;br /&gt;
being&lt;br /&gt;
guess&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary of a writer need not be coruscating or arcane or hermetic. Small and common words will do, and in most cases should do. Small words encourage precision and clarity. The order of such words, the manner in which they are structured as narrative and not as speech, determines much of the quality of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tip 5: Know your habits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the various strategies outlined above, writers also need to be aware of their individual proclivities: their habits of laziness, their favorite and over-used words, the ways in which they sacrifice clarity for muddiness. The following are the most common secondary errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Awkward phrase order in compound sentences&lt;br /&gt;
Awkward shifts of scene or tense&lt;br /&gt;
Awkward use of vocabulary&lt;br /&gt;
Lack of clear narrative direction&lt;br /&gt;
Stating the obvious rather than showing through imagery&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These habits and their kin -- the many pitfalls and hurdles that lie along the path of writing -- are avoided only through practice. Go slow, review each sentence as you write, make a list of your common errors and search for each error as you compose. Remember the primary goal: clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>Byways, back roads, and hidden treasure.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;p&gt;Try this: go to a bookstore and look at random pages of best-selling books -- novels, memoirs, whatever. After a while, you will unavoidably notice that the vast majority are (don't say it!) all the same. They utilize similar vocabulary and devices of plot and narrative. They have the same character, essentially. This is an artifact of the triumph of marketing over creativity. And this homogeneity has a stranglehold on the writing professions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please break this mold. Write well, write as yourself, write with your own non-conformist voice. As an aid in this practice, this week's writing activity involves a composition not based on your own ideas or directions but on snippets provided by history. The genre is mythological, which is to say that you can direct it wherever you are inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no correct answers or completions to the two parables, &lt;em&gt;The Warrior Princess&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Golden Key&lt;/em&gt;. Each is a starting place. Go where you will.&lt;/p&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>How the ancients wrote, and how they thought about writing.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;An Alternate View of the Writer’s Mind
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 547--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;The relationship between medium and message, which we exalt as a quintessentially modern discovery, was exhaustively explored five thousand years ago. Richard Wilkinson, in his &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art&lt;/span&gt; [London: Thames and Hudson, 1994], contends that Egyptian hieroglyphs “transcended the boundaries of most written scripts in successfully blending symbolic representation and the written word to a degree that no other system of writing has surpassed” (161). The integration of written language and symbol displays a level of virtuosity so profound that we can hardly grasp it. The interconnections of the Internet, for example, in which objects are embedded within objects in almost infinite, nested sequences, would have seemed, to the ancient Egyptians, rudimentary indeed. The Internet is, for all its complexity, a non-symbolic system: each of its elements (files, web pages, computer keyboards and monitors, cables, and so on) possesses a discrete and single-level meaning. A keyboard can be represented by an onscreen icon , but it cannot mean anything other than a keyboard — unless you give it further levels of meaning yourself (in which case other people may not understand you). &lt;!--l. 549--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; There are, in English, no shared multi-level meanings of a keyboard. But imagine what a hieroglyphic keyboard would have been like. Each key is shaped into a distinctive symbol, and the letter displayed upon it is an expression, in another form, of the same symbol. But not exactly the same: the letter is another flavor of the motif of the key. The placement of the keys is related to the fingers that touch them as you type, and the symbols of the keys relate to the symbolic functions of each finger. Moreover, the key placements are designed to evoke specific movements of the fingers as you type, the order of their action as well as the shapes they make. You animate animals and ideas and gods as you move your fingers. And you have a choice about what you animate, because every expression offers hundreds of ways to type it. You can write forwards or backwards, or vertically. You can change the order of letters, insert symbols that abstractly or concretely express the sense of your words. Your sentences can interlock like crossword puzzles. You can specify that your writing contain anywhere from two to twelve levels of meaning (but not one level, as in English). &lt;!--l. 551--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Every letter, every phrase, every passage you write is a hologram of your entire communication. From the simplest rebus to the most elaborate phonogram, every fragment is a map of the whole, and interconnects with every other fragment by way of a web of meanings so colossal no one can grasp all of it. Besides, the movements of your fingers evoke the gods in unfathomable ways, and they insert further meanings which you do not intend and do understand. The meaning of the text, finally — any text, from a household budget to a philosophical treatise — extends beyond the world, reaches toward the eternal. Your keyboard has five thousand keys. &lt;!--l. 553--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The symbology of Egyptian hieroglyphic texts employs the dialect of dreams: nuanced, multi-faceted, holographic. The glyphs are woven with interlocking symbols and strands of meaning through which reading becomes a devotional act. Word or phrase reversals — palindromes — hide in every text, leading the reader forward and back along a spiraling track of understanding. Every textual path unfolds in at least two directions: two truths, two selves. Palindromes are hinges upon which the attention of the reader turns. &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Ben &lt;/span&gt;is the primordial stone; &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;neb &lt;/span&gt;is gold, the symbol of conscious awareness (and the root of our modern word nebula). &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Ais &lt;/span&gt;is the brain, &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;sia &lt;/span&gt;consciousness. &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;Ab &lt;/span&gt;is the heart, &lt;span class=&quot;cmti-10&quot;&gt;ba &lt;/span&gt;the soul. These reflected and doubled pairs form a concealed language beneath the pragmatic. They turn awareness back on itself, back to the source. &lt;!--l. 555--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Passages are strung from left to right, as in English, or in reverse, or even vertically (top down, though never bottom up). The intended direction for reading is denoted by the orientation of the ideograms: an animal or a god looks toward the beginning of the text. A palindromic glyph passage can be written forward in a section of reversed text, or backward in a section of forward-facing text. Such suppleness of linguistic structure has made decipherment a difficult task. &lt;!--l. 557--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The thorniest aspect of the language involves the absence of written vowels. For the ancient Egyptians, vowels were the keys to magic and power; to speak them in the glyphs was to be in possession of the means to create a world. Scribes were sufficiently convinced of the inherent power of the vocalized glyphs that they were careful to limit that power: many of the glyphs inscribed on the stone walls in the pyramid of Unas were modified to prevent them from coming to life unbidden. Ideographic glyphs of birds were carved with their feet intentionally defaced so the birds could not launch themselves from the stone. Glyphs depicting humans were often carved with missing arms or legs. Sometimes substitute glyphs were used in place of those thought more likely to animate themselves. For the Egyptians, the hieroglyphs were, literally, living documents. &lt;!--l. 559--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Nowhere in the thousands of columns of the early Egyptian sacred texts is there hint of a single vowel. Our modern pronunciation of the lost language is a reconstruction, a best guess at where the vowels belong, but it’s not the language itself. The authentic voice of the words is gone. We are left to gather up the fragments of a library strewn across a debris field wide as history.

        <ALLTEXT>When we begin to craft narratives we simultaneously begin to call upon the themes of our creative lives: where are we, what are we doing, where are we going?

Review this week's material on the stages of creativity. Consider your own work, and where it might be positioned on this track. And consider your own life, too; after all, creativity and personal development are aspects of the same continuum.

As you work on your writing this week, think about your themes and directions. What, at heart, is your writing about?</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>A mythological journey...</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;The Creative Process is a Mythological Journey
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 418--&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;In which first there is: 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;dl class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;a beginning, an initiating force (or event) behind all creative and personal development. The Call is an unexpected event, a trauma, an intrusion into the sedate and comfortable lives we craft so carefully. In creative work, the Call is the moment of vision. In turn, it is a stage requiring of us a disruption in routines, an openness, an encouragement of the mystery. In myths and stories, the Call takes the symbol of the unexpected letter, or the sudden injury, or the surprising twist away from the ordinary. The Call is the gateway, and is followed in turn by:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Refusal of the Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;in which we assert for business as usual, for the way things were, for the re-establishment of our ordinary world. The task of the artist (and the writer) is to refuse to refuse. We must slow down, and listen, and open the eye of seeing. Universally, the opening of that eye is assisted by:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The stranger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;who we meet on the road: the wise one, the elder, the mentor. The stranger offers compassionate assistance, evokes our openness and our patience. Without the stranger, neither the work of creativity nor of healing is possible. With assistance from the stranger (who is an archetype, and may therefore also be a trusted friend), we cross the threshold, take a deep breath, and enter our own wilderness. Clarity is required here, and intent, and a willingness to open the gate. Wind lies on the other side, and the unknown. Our path lies that way, toward:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The labyrinth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;in which we become confused and disoriented. We seek but do not find shelter. We become lost, and fall into ourselves. Trusting the process is the task here: dealing with the dark, the cliff, the shadow. Discomfort, fear, and inertia become companions. We hear the monster which haunts all labyrinths, and which is our own inner life projected outward. But the labyrinth has one path only: toward a confrontation with the monster. We must keep going. All tales confirm this. And if we do keep going — simply, with trust, with purpose — we:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Face the monster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;and find the beast to be our own wisdom in disguise. The monster is a teacher, a guide, an enemy who becomes an ally. From the monster we learn:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Clarity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;and we move onward to discover the still point at the center of the labyrinth. Healing and spirituality and creativity reside at this center. Peace is made with the past there. We gather up the scattered threads of our inner knowing. We recognize the illumination to be found at the centre, and in so doing we begin to shape the tale of our journey. Above all other junctures in creative work, the still center is of the core and essence. It is here that all parts of ourselves align, and for a moment we glimpse ourselves all the way down into the Soul. When the still point arrives, creative work is almost done; healing is almost done. But first we must make our way back into the world, by way of:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The shallows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;and the bridge, which will deliver us back to the world we departed so long ago. That land now seems foreign, and strange, and we find ourselves uncertain about how to find our place within it. Creativity, after all, is a journey of the inner life, and is only peripherally about what we craft. Creativity is the personal path inward, toward our own discoveries. The shallows and the bridge are ways forward, and outward, to:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;to the world, to the bright day of sharing our discoveries with the community. And yet, because the inner journey is so rich, and intense, and powerful, often we:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Refusal to return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;and instead we become addicts of the creative process. We want to move to a mountain hut, we wish to leave the world by way of the imagination. Creative work becomes its own hurdle on the path. We dream of becoming the eternal traveler on that wondrous path. But, as the old stories tell, there appears again:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The stranger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;who calls us back (and who need not be the same stranger); the one who invites and demands that we share our work with the world — so that they too might see, and know, and be healed. They set watch fires for us, and they wait, and we embark upon a mysterious journey back. We cross:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The return threshold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;and enter the world again. We bear gifts of wisdom and of healing. We have been burned by the light of illumination and are healed. We share our gifts with the community; and in this celebration there is a pausing, a:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;Conscious integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;of what we have undertaken and learned, a recognition of wholeness and completion and healing. We become the stranger for others. We have crossed the wide sea and know its ways. We rest, for a moment. And in this space of quiet, while we are not paying attention:&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;description&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cmbx-10&quot;&gt;The cycle begins again.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>No islands; only peninsulas and estuaries.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>Despite popular misconception, especially within the creative professions, the creative process does not and cannot function in isolation. Creative work depends entirely on the community, on collaboration and support, on the fragile and enduring connections between people. Without the contributions and contradictions of others, our creative work becomes empty and devoid of purpose.

So, this week our efforts are turned toward working with others, to seeing what surprising turns and odd conjunctions might arise. In the exercises for this week you may find that working with another participant in our class will be most beneficial. If you are unable to arrange this, you may (as a distant second choice) work with someone else in your circle of friends and family. I will leave it to you to choose someone who is appropriate and enthusiastic.</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>Tips and imperatives from the master(s)</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h4&gt;Elementary rules of usage 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Form the possessive singular of nouns with ’s. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Place a comma before ‘and’ or ‘but’ introducing an independent clause. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not join independent clauses by a comma. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Do not break sentences in two. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and pronunciation. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Elementary principles of composition 
&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the beginning. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use the active voice. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Put statements in positive form. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Omit needless words. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid a succession of loose sentences. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Keep related words together. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In summaries, keep to one tense. 
  &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;br /&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end. 
  &lt;/li&gt;

        <SUMMARY>Ethical Dilemmas</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>&lt;h3 class=&quot;sectionHead&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;titlemark&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ethical Dilemmas 
&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;!--l. 634--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the following ethical dilemmas have been stripped of identifying facts; but they have not been disguised in any way. Each of the following situations is real. You may easily be able to identify some of the authors involved. 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 1 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 636--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You are a board member of an organization that supports rights and freedoms worldwide. Part of the organization’s mandate is to provide assistance, including funding, to writers and artists who find themselves at odds with legal systems and governments that do not recognize freedom of expression. Past funding recipients have included imprisoned writers, exiled writers, and those at odds with various political movements. Funding takes the form of grants that are decided upon by a committee that evaluates nominations each year. A typical grant is between one thousand and ten thousand dollars. You are a member of the evaluation committee. &lt;!--l. 638--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; One of the applications for a 2004 grant involves a Canadian who is writing about a famous criminal case in which the details were disturbing enough that a ban upon publication was issued. The writer in question is alleged to have broken this publication ban and now faces 97 criminal charges laid by the Canadian government. The writer has published two books about the criminal case, each of which contains unique details derived from privileged court documents. The writer feels he is being unfairly persecuted, and is seeking legal funding assistance for his upcoming court battle. &lt;!--l. 640--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Should he get it? &lt;!--l. 642--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 2 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 643--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;As a struggling writer, you frequently do other kinds of work to support yourself: ditch-digging, laundry service, waiting tables. Sometimes you do editing for other writers. You take on an editing project for a writer who could generously be called eccentric. He has good ideas, but his his writing is far from good. You work with him, and you craft a book together. But the vast majority of the writing is actually done by you. All but the last twenty pages is entirely your work. &lt;!--l. 645--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The book is published, but with no mention of your involvement. You receive no credit whatsoever. After its release, the book is met with critical acclaim and wins a prestigious literary prize. The author (in fact the author is essentially you, but the author in name is the other person) refrains from mentioning your involvement whenever he is interviewed about the book and the process of writing it. &lt;!--l. 647--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; You become frustrated, and decide to come forward. You ask the ‘author’ why he has not credited you. In response, he writes you a letter (in which he proves his poor writing skill), and says, among other things, that you are “dull, colourless, vulgar, and a complete failure.” He speaks of legal action, saying “rest assured my campaign has just began [sic]. I have set aside fifty thousand of my hard-earned money to ruin you.” &lt;!--l. 649--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; What do you do? &lt;!--l. 651--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 3 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 652--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You are working on a contemporary novel of interconnected stories based on your cultural and religious background. The religion of your background, like every religion, has strict adherents, moderates, non-practicing members, and a few extremists. The novel involves a revisioning of some of the religious stories of your background, and you are aware that some of what you write may be considered blasphemous to strict adherents (many of whom live in your community) and certainly to extremists. Moderates, on the other hand, will welcome your work as an invitation to conversation about the ways in which religions must be updated and adapted to the modern world. &lt;!--l. 654--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; What do you do? &lt;!--l. 656--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 4 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 657--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You write a non-fiction book that explores alternative historical ideas. You complete exhaustive, original research. You present, for the first time in print, a compelling alternative view of one of the basic threads of accepted religious history. Your book does well. Twenty0 years pass. A new book, a novel that clearly builds upon your ideas, is published. The ideas and themes in the new book are clearly derived from your work. It’s as if the author simply took your ideas, adapted them slightly into different language, and added a novelistic plot. The new book is, in fact, a detective story. &lt;!--l. 660--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; In interviews, the author of the novel acts as though he did the research, he discovered these interesting threads of alternative history, he is the scholar and innovator. From your point of view, he has stolen your intellectual property. &lt;!--l. 662--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; What do you do? &lt;!--l. 664--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4 class=&quot;subsectionHead&quot;&gt;Ethical Dilemma 5 
&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;!--l. 665--&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;You are a member of a culture with a contemporary history of trauma and appropriation (let us say, broadly speaking, that yours is an aboriginal culture). A poet and storyteller (someone not from your culture) shows great interest in the myths and stories of your people. He makes friends with you, your family, and your extended community. You recognize that he is ideally suited for the tasks of transcribing and interpreting the archaic myths of your culture — which, if something is not done, will soon be lost. Such myths, after all, tend to fade away during times of great cultural change. &lt;!--l. 667--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; The poet writes several books of and about your cultural myths. These books do well: they are professionally produced and do not appear to have been done solely in service of the poet’s own career. Additionally, the books provide a contextualization of your cultural myths in terms of archetypal or universal themes in other literatures. In other words, the poet succeeds in securing for your myths a unique place in world literature. No one in your culture possesses the literary background to accomplish this important task. &lt;!--l. 670--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; However. After the books come out, you hear grumblings from various people in your community about the things the poet got wrong, how he told incomplete or improper tales, how he failed to consult the proper people. Slowly, animosity grows in your community, and the poet is no longer entirely welcome there. &lt;!--l. 672--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; Where do you stand? &lt;!--l. 674--&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; (And, turn it around: imagine you are the poet.)

        <NAME>This Week's Topic: Starting the Final Project</NAME>
        <TYPE>text</TYPE>
        <REFERENCE>0</REFERENCE>
        <SUMMARY> Get going!</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>The final project will require sustained focus and effort. This is why you have a total of three weeks to work on it. Please review the Start Here entry from the beginning of the course if you are unsure about how long the final project should be. As I write this, I'm thinking about William Langeweische's Fear and Lodging essay, which seems about the perfect length for its content. (The essay is roughly 4,000 words long.)

For your own essay, start with a theme: a family story, an observation about nature, an experience that affected you. Where you start matters less than where you go (on the other hand, you should start out as you plan to go on...). But wherever you go, however the essay unfolds, focus on developing the tightness and clarity of your prose.

Ask me for help if you get stuck, or don't know where to start, or start out and become mired in the various mucky things writers seem prone to.

Write well. This is the goal. Not the grade, nor the brevity of your effort, nor aims of publishing, nor any other consideration. Just the writing.

Submit your final project to me, and also post it on the forum.</ALLTEXT>

        <SUMMARY>A parable of envy.</SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>I was reading a poem by W. S. Merwin in the New Yorker the other day
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;and as usual I was feeling pretty intimidated by all those long lines
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;he always writes and of course all the stuff that was going to be
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;in there about how things look in New England especially in the fall
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;and maybe even trout fishing and what it all means to the human soul
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;on a universal level because Fall in New England is always dynamic
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;and everywhere else is parochial but I decided to read his poem
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;anyway because I thought maybe I could just stand it
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;and he started in by talking about a barn door and some
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;stones on a hillside and an old man hoeing the dirt which seemed
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;allright to me even though it was as usual Fall in New England
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;because I really liked the imagery he made which is something
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;I always like because it puts pictures in my head even if I
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;am parochial and never even seen New England in the Fall when he
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;started in to saying as to how all this imagery really felt to him
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;which also meant how his personal feelings were all
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;about what the universal condition of man is and I got to
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;thinking about how glad I was I wasn’t in some English
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;class again because those last five or six lines about universal
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;New England consciousness are always the ones your
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;freshman English instructor wants you to write a six page
&lt;br class=&quot;newline&quot; /&gt;double-spaced paper on and I hate it when that happens

        <SUMMARY> Working on your project... </SUMMARY>
        <ALLTEXT>Here are a few tips for the final project:

1. Start where you are. Write about what you see, right now, in your life. Use the evidence of your senses to start and sustain your narrative.

2. You do not have to write about yourself.

3. Let the narrative build itself. Allow yourself to be guided by the words, the flow, the rhythm. Don't overplan. Just let the piece come to life. 

Example: walking at Burns Bog, from my upcoming addictions book:

In the west, where a peninsula of ragged-top forest stands above sand cliffs, a grove of hardwood trees shows yellowing leaves against the backdrop of green. We glimpse fragments of amber and copper, and faded crimson from what is probably a stretch of vine maples.

We come here most days. The light and the seasons change around us, and new flotsam washes up after storms: foam fishing floats, cracked and sodden plywood, long ropes of kelp, plastic pails overturned in the sand. An entire swimming float once came ashore. It now lies firmly on the mud, hundreds of yards from the shoreline, clear fir planks ready for sunbathers who will never come.

Sandpipers flit and call at our approach. Ducks ignore us, as do gulls. We make our way along the shore, watching farmers flood cranberry fields for harvest. Sometimes the kids accompany us on our walks, often on their bikes. They pedal on the grassy verge, free of traffic and stop signs and blind corners. In my mind's eye, I watch Elizabeth with our children: she moves toward Rowan to help her with a caught pant leg. Avery coasts his bike to a stop and waits. He looks at the outflow of the stream as it meanders along the flats, and I wonder what he is thinking.

I see them this way, as though stilled and moving forward. Their momentum carries me, draws me ever into their circle, and I am held there as the driftwood tree is held by love of the shore.

I have been salvaged by them from the emptiness of elsewhere. By the virtues of others more than by my own casting about. I see the faraway look in the eyes of the wanderers on the street: distant shores, high peaks, sandstone temples. I hear it in Joseph's talk of the whales and their remote beauty. Perhaps I've been luckier. I have not slept in doorways, nor hid from the wind in cold cities on nights when the office towers burn bright. But I have wandered, purposeless, beyond the rim of my known world. I have spent too much time looking for gates into promised worlds of solace and wonder. Too many shamanic rituals and esoteric meditations and journeys to monasteries in the East.

I told the old man on the Srinagar road that I avoided loneliness in my wandering by meeting interesting people. Yes, he agreed, one does meet people.  &quot;But they are not your people.&quot;
...

4. Don't stop too soon. Write until the piece is done. When is it done? When it's done.

        <ALLTEXT>We will refine the topics this last session as the course progresses. But essentially, this is where we tie up the loose ends, hear the plaintive moans about why the final project is not yet done, endure the appeals for extensions and the taking of pity. Or, in the unlikely but happy event that we are up to speed with one another and with our projects, we'll tackle the questions surrounding how to become a professional writer.</ALLTEXT>
