An Argument for Minimalist Writing Tools</A>
</H1>
In a recent workshop on the materials and tools of writing I asked the group to indicate which method they used to input text on a computer. Almost everyone used <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Microsoft Word</SPAN> -- with the exception of a sole advocate for the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">OpenOffice</SPAN> word processor (which is far better than <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Word</SPAN>, and which uses the open source XML file format).

<P>
But the trend -- even among seasoned writers -- seemed decidedly weighted toward mainstream word processors. This homogenization of word processing, whether on the Mac or PC, inevitably delivers a consistent -- and therefore conformist -- experience to the act of typing on screen. The method of input unquestionably influences the output. By way of subtle cues and imagery (icons, menus, procedures), word processors inculcate a particular type of consciousness. Works of writing from different authors but produced on the same word processor will be more similar than those produced using separate tools. The differences will be subtle but not inconsequential.

<P>
Moreover, all word processors introduce a level of aesthetic abstraction that is perhaps not useful to the writing process. Word processors encourage us to fiddle with fonts and spacing, with countless page layout options, with the visual aspect of work that in its initial stages should be primarily visceral.

<P>
And word processors are ergonomically inefficient. The mouse, which requires the full use of one arm, is a primary tool in word processors, as are menus and keystrokes assigned for mnemonic rather than ergonomic functions (control-S to save, for example, requires the removal of the left hand from the home row of the keyboard). Years ago, as I began to understand that my persistent arthritic aches were essentially caused by mouse and keyboard use, ergonomics became a core consideration.

<P>
Another liability of word processors involves their proprietary file formats, which impede the export and transfer of information to open source formats, such as are found on the World Wide Web. If you want to publish on the Web, word processors make this extraordinarily difficult. Moreover, consider this: if you are writing in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Word</SPAN>, Microsoft owns your material. After all, your text is in their file format, and if you want to view or edit that text you need to buy their software. Does this seem like an equitable or safe arrangement in terms of safeguarding your intellectual property?

<P>
Now, to alternatives and solutions. Go online and search for Bram Moolenaar's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Seven Habits of Effective Text Editing</SPAN> (Bram's examples use the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN> editor, but are germane to writing in general). Learn to reduce the number and increase the efficiency of the keystrokes you make. Wean yourself from the mouse. And by all means look into <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN>, which is a most robust and efficient text editor (Bram is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN>'s main creator). <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN> was originally designed for the Unix operating system, and its current version is used mostly by Linux users (like me). However, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Cream</SPAN> is a vim equivalent for Windows.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN> is cryptic, it has a steep learning curve, and some of its functions are improbably arcane. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Emacs</SPAN>, another editor that originally evolved on Unix (and which I used to write this reader) is similarly cryptic and powerful. In this sense, these editors mirror the writing process. Unlike word processors, which blanket that process, covering it with neat type, text editors lay bare your words and force you to face the page.

<P>
Although <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vim</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Emacs</SPAN> and other minimalist tools (such as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">BBEdit</SPAN>, for the Mac) are used mostly by programmers, writers are increasingly recognizing the advantages of such tools. They are immeasurably more powerful and efficient for writing of all kinds.

<P>
In its beginnings and its evolution, the act of writing is about the bare bones, the essential, the elemental. Use a tool that delivers, rather than distracts, from that wonderful trajectory.
