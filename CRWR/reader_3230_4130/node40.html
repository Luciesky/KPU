An Alternate View of the Writer's Mind</A>
</H2>
The relationship between medium and message, which we exalt as a quintessentially modern discovery, was exhaustively explored five thousand years ago. Richard Wilkinson, in his <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art</SPAN> [London: Thames and Hudson, 1994], contends that Egyptian hieroglyphs ``transcended the boundaries of most written scripts in successfully blending symbolic representation and the written word to a degree that no other system of writing has surpassed'' (161). The integration of written language and symbol displays a level of virtuosity so profound that we can hardly grasp it. The interconnections of the Internet, for example, in which objects are embedded within objects in almost infinite, nested sequences, would have seemed, to the ancient Egyptians, rudimentary indeed. The Internet is, for all its complexity, a non-symbolic system: each of its elements (files, web pages, computer keyboards and monitors, cables, and so on) possesses a discrete and single-level meaning. A keyboard can be represented by an onscreen icon , but it cannot mean anything other than a keyboard -- unless you give it further levels of meaning yourself (in which case other people may not understand you).

<P>
There are, in English, no shared multi-level meanings of a keyboard. But imagine what a hieroglyphic keyboard would have been like. Each key is shaped into a distinctive symbol, and the letter displayed upon it is an expression, in another form, of the same symbol. But not exactly the same: the letter is another flavor of the motif of the key. The placement of the keys is related to the fingers that touch them as you type, and the symbols of the keys relate to the symbolic functions of each finger. Moreover, the key placements are designed to evoke specific movements of the fingers as you type, the order of their action as well as the shapes they make. You animate animals and ideas and gods as you move your fingers. And you have a choice about what you animate, because every expression offers hundreds of ways to type it. You can write forwards or backwards, or vertically. You can change the order of letters, insert symbols that abstractly or concretely express the sense of your words. Your sentences can interlock like crossword puzzles. You can specify that your writing contain anywhere from two to twelve levels of meaning (but not one level, as in English).

<P>
Every letter, every phrase, every passage you write is a hologram of your entire communication. From the simplest rebus to the most elaborate phonogram, every fragment is a map of the whole, and interconnects with every other fragment by way of a web of meanings so colossal no one can grasp all of it. Besides, the movements of your fingers evoke the gods in unfathomable ways, and they insert further meanings which you do not intend and do understand. The meaning of the text, finally -- any text, from a household budget to a philosophical treatise -- extends beyond the world, reaches toward the eternal. Your keyboard has five thousand keys.

<P>
The symbology of Egyptian hieroglyphic texts employs the dialect of dreams: nuanced, multi-faceted, holographic. The glyphs are woven with interlocking symbols and strands of meaning through which reading becomes a devotional act. Word or phrase reversals -- palindromes -- hide in every text, leading the reader forward and back along a spiraling track of understanding. Every textual path unfolds in at least two directions: two truths, two selves. Palindromes are hinges upon which the attention of the reader turns. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ben</SPAN> is the primordial stone; <SPAN  CLASS="textit">neb</SPAN> is gold, the symbol of conscious awareness (and the root of our modern word nebula). <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ais</SPAN> is the brain, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sia</SPAN> consciousness. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ab</SPAN> is the heart, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ba</SPAN> the soul. These reflected and doubled pairs form a concealed language beneath the pragmatic. They turn awareness back on itself, back to the source.

<P>
Passages are strung from left to right, as in English, or in reverse, or even vertically (top down, though never bottom up). The intended direction for reading is denoted by the orientation of the ideograms: an animal or a god looks toward the beginning of the text. A palindromic glyph passage can be written forward in a section of reversed text, or backward in a section of forward-facing text. Such suppleness of linguistic structure has made decipherment a difficult task.

<P>
The thorniest aspect of the language involves the absence of written vowels. For the ancient Egyptians, vowels were the keys to magic and power; to speak them in the glyphs was to be in possession of the means to create a world. Scribes were sufficiently convinced of the inherent power of the vocalized glyphs that they were careful to limit that power: many of the glyphs inscribed on the stone walls in the pyramid of Unas were modified to prevent them from coming to life unbidden. Ideographic glyphs of birds were carved with their feet intentionally defaced so the birds could not launch themselves from the stone. Glyphs depicting humans were often carved with missing arms or legs. Sometimes substitute glyphs were used in place of those thought more likely to animate themselves. For the Egyptians, the hieroglyphs were, literally, living documents.

<P>
Nowhere in the thousands of columns of the early Egyptian sacred texts is there hint of a single vowel. Our modern pronunciation of the lost language is a reconstruction, a best guess at where the vowels belong, but it's not the language itself. The authentic voice of the words is gone. We are left to gather up the fragments of a library strewn across a debris field wide as history.
