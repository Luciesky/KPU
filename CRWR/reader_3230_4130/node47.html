Ethical Dilemma 2</A>
</H2>
As a struggling writer, you frequently do other kinds of work to support yourself: ditch-digging, laundry service, waiting tables. Sometimes you do editing for other writers. You take on an editing project for a writer who could generously be called eccentric. He has good ideas, but his his writing is far from good. You work with him, and you craft a book together. But the vast majority of the writing is actually done by you. All but the last twenty pages is entirely your work.

<P>
The book is published, but with no mention of your involvement. You receive no credit whatsoever. After its release, the book is met with critical acclaim and wins a prestigious literary prize. The ‘author’ (in fact the author is essentially you, but the author in name is the other person) refrains from mentioning your involvement whenever he is interviewed about the book and the process of writing it.

<P>
You become frustrated, and decide to come forward. You ask the `author' why he has not credited you. In response, he writes you a letter (in which he proves his poor writing skill), and says, among other things, that you are ``dull, colourless, vulgar, and a complete failure.'' He speaks of legal action, saying ``rest assured my campaign has just began [sic]. I have set aside fifty thousand of my hard-earned money to ruin you.''

<P>
What do you do?
