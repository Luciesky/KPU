On Reading W.S. Merwin in <SPAN  CLASS="textit">The New Yorker</SPAN></A>
</H1>
I was reading a poem by W. S. Merwin in the New Yorker the other day
<BR>
and as usual I was feeling pretty intimidated by all those long lines
<BR>
he always writes and of course all the stuff that was going to be
<BR>
in there about how things look in New England especially in the fall
<BR>
and maybe even trout fishing and what it all means to the human soul
<BR>
on a
universal level because Fall in New England is always dynamic
<BR>
and everywhere else is parochial but I decided to read his poem
<BR>
anyway because I thought maybe I could just stand it
<BR>
and he started in by talking about a barn door and some 
<BR>
stones on a hillside and an old man hoeing the dirt which seemed
<BR>
allright to me even though it was as usual Fall in New England
<BR>
because I really liked the imagery he made which is something
<BR>
I always like because it puts pictures in my head even if I
<BR>
am parochial and never even seen New England in the Fall when he
<BR>
started in to saying as to how all this imagery really felt to him
<BR>
which also meant how his personal feelings were all
<BR>
about what the universal condition of man is and I got to 
<BR>
thinking about how glad I was I wasn't in some English
<BR>
class again because those last five or six lines about universal
<BR>
New England consciousness are always the ones your
<BR>
freshman English instructor wants you to write a six page
<BR>
double-spaced paper on and I hate it when that happens
<BR>
