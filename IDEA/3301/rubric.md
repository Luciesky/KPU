Thinking About a Rubric for Your Group Presentation
===================================================

By designing a rubric and questions for the audience to contemplate
(either during or after the performance, depending on the goals and
the presentation), you invite everyone to reflect on the nature and
purpose of group sharing and performance. The goal of the rubric is to
stimulate conversation and reflection.

Here are a few sample skills from the group presentation portion of
the course outline. Think about which ones best suit your
presentation:

* Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
* Willingness to speak up and to lead.
* Openness to interpersonal process.
* Willingness to collaborate with others.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
* Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

Don’t use everything from the above list, and don’t just copy the list
and make a rubric. These are suggestions for thinking about a
direction for creating your own rubric; they are not the rubric
itself. Basically you want the group to answer a couple of questions
along the following lines:

* How did it go?
* What worked well?
* What seemed to not work so well?
* How was the performance of the presenting group?
* Did X work better than Y?
* What would you have liked to see more of (or less of)?
* Was there something in particular that was very engaging, interesting, or helpful?
* If you were doing this presentation, what would you change?

Again, you don’t need to ask all of these questions (or any of
them). The goal is to ask *your own questions* in a rubric with just a
few items (about 3 to 5).

Feel free to use a rubric that does not involve a list of
questions. You might get creative with rubrics based on movement,
sound, imagery, or any creative modality. The main thing is to find an
effective means of gathering feedback.
