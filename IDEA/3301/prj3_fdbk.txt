It's good to see your "mythological creativity" expanding in this project. It seems that once we start to think of greater number of things in mythological ways, our creativity grows more encompassing. It's an interesting process.

Continue to think widely about the mythological aspects of things. Also continue to work on fluidity in your compositions (transitions, tightness, rhythm) -- these come with practice.

Thanks for being in the course. You made a strong contribution in many ways.

Final score: 

I hope to see you in other courses. But if I don't, best of luck with your studies and with whatever mythological paths you find yourself upon.

Cheers.
