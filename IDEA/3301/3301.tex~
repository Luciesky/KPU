\subsection{Basic Philosophy of the Course}
Writing is a powerful, ancient, and yet delicate practice. We write~--- quietly, often in isolation, in tentative and mercurial
moods. We revise, and turn back upon our own narratives, and wonder about the reception our work might meet in the world. Sometimes we hide manuscripts in drawers, or take deliberate action~--- as did Franz Kafka and Mahatma Gandhi~--- to prevent our words from making their way to an audience. Kafka and Gandhi were both unsuccessful in preventing their writings from being destroyed; but their impulse to do so, to keep hooded the hawk of their creativity, is common among writers of all stripes.

We're not sure that we have, really, anything to say; or we are afraid that if our words are not well met we might ourselves be wounded. Or we believe, as did the ancient Egyptians, that words have their own life, for good or for ill, and that writing is a means of seizing the power of the gods. This course attempts to explore this conversation ~--- between the writer and the wider world~--- and to find ways of bringing our writing safely out of hiding.

We will be exploring myth, and writing craft, and method, and the strategic practices every writer must learn in wrestling with narrative. Each of us will examine our strengths~--- the ways in which the natural mood and flavour of our writing makes itself known~--- and our vulnerabilities as well: how we get stuck, or lazy, how we lost confidence and gain doubt. How we learn to shut down and hope the whole thing will go away.

This course is about creativity, writing, reading, and making a claim for the fundamental right of storytelling. Within that context, we will
explore the ancient practices of myth-making (particularly as regards family and culture), the hurdles of writing (as they involve craft and
precision and clarity) and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that is to say, the long tradition of writers of writers and myth-makers).

The threshold between fact and fiction (which is not the same as that between truth and lie) is one of the territories of myth. In this course we stake out that territory, inspecting the geology of its forms and ideals, finding our own individual places to homestead. Myth involves the search for truth, and fidelity to fact, yet also an awareness that truth and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do about it.

And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the foundation of all the arts and sciences.

\subsection{Learning Goals}
\begin{itemize}

\item Read selected cultural, literary, historical and mythological texts and discuss their origin, development, and contemporary relevance
\item Interpret multicultural literary traditions within the context of mythopoetic origins
\item Exhibit knowledge of mythology as both an ancient and a current mode of transmission of important cultural, political, and psychological knowledge
\item Evaluate diverse perspectives on the nature and role of myth
\item Develop a research-based project on a topic related to mythology
\item Compose writing compositions using mythopoetic narrative strategies

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learning Experiences}
The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creative writing and mythology are both interactive processes, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, composition, and practical assignments.

We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Repeat: we are not creating such a group. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and
we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.

\section{Demonstration of Learning}

\subsection{Written Assignments}
Three creative compositions are required for this course: a research project and two mythological compositions. The research project involves you choosing a specific mythological theme or thread and exploring it in some depth (not necessarily in writing). The creative compositions are opportunities for you to discover and explore the myths surrounding your own life or interests.

For philosophical reasons, I do not prescribe a particular length for the projects: a great mythological composition can be a few pages long (as we'll see). Yet it is difficult to craft a good mythological composition in less than a few thousand words. So, if you prefer a guideline for the length of the projects, I offer two recommendations: make them as long as they need to be; make them somewhere between two and five thousand words. There is no upper limit on the length of the projects.

I'm not interested in how much you can write but rather in the quality of your writing. Perhaps you write like Hemingway, perhaps like
Melville or Tolstoy. I don't know, and maybe you don't know either. But I can tell you this: writing a shorter piece of great precision is
more difficult than writing a longer, more relaxed and wandering work. In the context of smaller projects every word is on display and under
scrutiny, whereas in longer works the sheer bulk of the material tends to hide various flaws. Melville, in fact, is a good example of this.

You may write short narratives in this course, but please do not write short form as a means of avoiding work. You will know, I will notice,
and neither of us will be happy. Instead, make your work as long as it needs to be. If you compose a lovely, resonant, short piece, you will
receive an excellent evaluation. But as I said, writing shorter pieces is actually more difficult.

The three written compositions are worth 25 per cent each of your final grade.

\subsubsection{Assessment Criteria for Creative Compositions}

Projects for this course are focused on creativity. Accordingly, the following criteria -- which are based on the philosophy of creativity  --  are used to evaluate engagement and commitment to the projects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself creatively.
\item Willingness to try new things, especially when doing so provokes creative discomfort.
\item Openness to personal and interpersonal process.
\item Willingness to collaborate with others.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility and initiative for learning.
\item Willingness to approach creativity as a skill with discrete steps and standards.
\item Commitment to improvement in writing and other creative projects.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Group Presentations and Overall Engagement}

Each student will be a member of the class group and also of several different peer groups; each peer group will present to the class on various mythological motifs and characters. Beginning in week four, each class session will involve presentations. Class time will be given for preparing the presentations. The structure and content of the presentations will be discussed in class.

\subsubsection{Presentation Methods and Goals}

The central goal of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities to practice interdisciplinary, mythological thinking and expression. As such, the presentations should be interdisciplinary. Essentially, this means that you should try to use multiple presentation
 strategies and modalities. These might include (but are certainly not  limited to) any of the following:

 \begin{itemize}
 \item Storytelling
 \item Poetry
 \item Music (playing)
 \item Drumming
 \item Singing
 \item Dance
 \item Movement
 \item Sport
 \item Ritual
 \item Film (showing)
 \item Film making
 \item Photography
 \item Web content
 \item Craft work
 \item Art making
 \item Individual reflection
 \item Meditation
 \item Health practices
 \item Creative process (any type)
 \item Group communication
 \item Cultural practices
 \item Nature experiences
 \end{itemize}

 Whenever possible (and workable), try to mix together multiple modalities into a single presentation. For example, you might ask the
 group to do some individual reflection using the modality of poetry,  then create a series of movements based on the poetry, then work in
 small groups to talk about and share the process. Many configurations are possible. The trick is to choose an activity that you enjoy, then
 find a way to apply it to the content (suggested presentation topics are listed below). Please do not create your presentations using only
 written and/or spoken materials. In other words, don't just stand up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic.
 Utilize the energy of the group. Remember that in interdisciplinary work divergences are valued as unique opportunities. So, feel free to
 experiment with activities and modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand but which might, upon
 experiment, yield surprising connections and results. Be playful. Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage
 with the process in novel and interesting ways.

In interdisciplinary work, riddles and puzzles are highly prized. Accordingly, the presentations should (ideally) not be complete
explanations or presentations of material. Feel free to play with challenging exercises, with impossible scenarios, and other conundra.
One way to think about this is to consider insoluble riddles, such as the one in \textit{Alice in Wonderland}: Why is a raven like a
writing desk?

\begin{quote}
  ``Have you guessed the riddle yet?'' the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\\
``No, I give it up,'' Alice replied. ``What's the answer?''\\
``I haven't the slightest idea,'' said the Hatter.\\
``Nor I,'' said the March Hare.\\
Alice sighed wearily. ``I think you might do something better with the time,'' she said, ``than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.''
\end{quote}

The best interdisciplinary topics offer more questions than answers. They, are essentially, gateways into the mysterious~--- which, as
Einstein will tell you, is an important place to be:

\begin{quote}
  The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is
  the source of all true art and science.
\end{quote}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assessment Criteria for Group Presentations and Overall Engagement}

This course utilizes experiential learning approaches, which depend upon student involvement and active participation. Accordingly, the following criteria are used to evaluate overall participation and engagement in the group presentations and the class:

\begin{itemize}
\item Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.
\item Willingness to speak up and to lead.
\item Openness to interpersonal process.
\item Willingness to collaborate with others.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
\item Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
 
\end{itemize}


The group presentations and overall course engagement are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.

\subsection{Attendance and Participation}
The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process, to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all central to your involvement in this class. Because developing a style of creativity is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

Creativity is a unique process. Unlike many other fields, in which competence and skill may be measured objectively, using replicable and consistent means (tests of factual knowledge, for example), authentic creativity depends greatly on the interpersonal skills of the practitioner. Computer programmers can be assessed by their ability to write code; chiropractors can be evaluated based on their skill at manipulating the human skeleton; race car drivers can be clocked around a track. But for writers and artists there are no such fixed measures. The interpersonal skills upon which creativity so much depends are subtle, difficult to quantify, and complex beyond any measurement scheme.

And yet we can identify those who possess exemplary personal and creative skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, kind. Often they exhibit skills that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:

\begin{itemize}
\item Commitment to the development of self-awareness.
\item Openness to interpersonal process.
\item Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.
\item Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
\item Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.
\item Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
\item Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
\item Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
\item Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.
\end{itemize}

Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:

\begin{itemize}
\item What am I feeling right now?
\item What am I thinking right now?
\item Why am I reacting in this particular way?
\item What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
\item Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
\item Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
\item When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
\item In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?
 
\end{itemize}

These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you. At the very least, you might wish to consider what you are currently working on in your life, in which direction your attention is drawn, into which of the innumerable themes of human nature you are now called to delve.

In my role as your instructor, I will be paying attention to how thoughtful you are in examining and responding to questions like those in the lists above. I will not be analyzing you, but rather noticing what kinds of things you do, what your reactions are to various situations. My goal in observing your behaviors and interacting with you is to assist you in developing greater self-awareness (and, by extension, greater creativity).

I will use the lists above, as well as the assessment criteria listed for each assignment, to assess your overall participation in the course. I will not be evaluating your level of self-awareness but rather your openness to the process of developing your self-awareness.

\subsection{Grade Inflation}
Almost every semester there are students who do well on the assignments, complete all the associated learning goals of the course,
participate well, and wonder why they do not receive a grade of one hundred percent (or 98, anyway). Here is the reason: almost every
semester there are students who demonstrates a level of commitment that goes beyond the course requirement. Such students complete extra
work, or hand in exemplary assignments, or undertake a significant amount of personal development in addition to the course expectations.
Such students typically receive the highest grades.

If you do reasonably well in the course you will receive a reasonable grade. Very high grades are intended for extra or exemplary work.
Unfortunately, over the past thirty years the post-secondary educational system in North America has participated in a process of
grade inflation. Since the 1980's, the average grade for typical course work has been increasing by about 25 per cent each decade.
Elevated assessments do not accurately reflect the work of most students. Even worse, grade inflation has caused many students to
expect high grades for average work. I am not a overly stringent assessor; but I will not inflate grades artificially.

In this course a small number of students will (likely) receive high grades; most students will receive grades in the middle range; and a few students will struggle with lower grades. If you are uncertain about your assessment for a given assignment, or if you wish to know where, roughly, you are along the distribution curve of the class, or if you would like suggestions for how to improve your grade, please ask me for clarification.

If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Show up for class -- every class. This course depends on student engagement. (This becomes especially important during the final weeks of the semester.)
\item Be attentive and mindful to the various criteria listed for each of the projects and the course overall.
\item Take the initiative to plan and develop your projects and presentations. This course is (very likely) more fluid and spontaneous than you are used to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is crucial.
\item Speak up in every class (review the criteria for group engagement and presentations).
\item Don't look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead, find the answer that is meaningful to you.
\item Ask for help if you need it.
\item Commit to your projects in a substantial way. Good projects take time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Creative Composition: The World Tree}

South of the riverbend, twenty minutes along a trail fringed with pink
flowers of hardhack and gangly stalks of sweet gale, the World Tree
stands against a spring sky. Through a lattice of dark branches
restless with vigor, nomadic flecks of blue sweep toward the horizon.
An eagle rides a crest of sea air, glances down, then spirals away.
Underfoot, the ground is damp, yielding. A long skein of root twists
out from the great trunk, meanders toward a bristled head of
cottongrass. The bole of the tree is broad; black furrows streaked
with umber climb skyward along its body. High up, a rustling brown
blur -- squirrel -- cracks a narrow branch. The quick trill of a robin
sounds nearby. Here, within earshot of the encroaching highways of
suburban Vancouver, myth and dream and the rhythm of day collide in
the slow unfurling of the world. 

The low branches of this ancient black spruce -- sweeping upward like
fractured tusks, riddled with worm tracks -- are the steps of an ancient
ladder into the sky. Twenty feet up, a canopy of moss hangs from
encircling boughs over the quiet clearing. The air breathes, exhales
with the tang of Labrador tea. The World Tree, resting here in a glade
at the edge of the bog, is the true axis of the earth. It extends from
an unfathomable root in the underworld, through a trunk scaled like
dragon-hide, turbulent as smoke, and reaches, with new and tender
shoots, upward. A shimmering and deathless bird perches, vigilant, at
its peak. It was here, beside the pool of memory and prophecy at the
base of the tree Yggdrasil, that Odin surrendered his one eye in
exchange for a single drink from the well. Even now, a pool of dark,
standing water lies at the bottom of a hollow between two intertwined
roots. The hole is lined with black soil. A small blueberry leaf spins
slowly in the water. 

The roots snake together at the base of the trunk. I follow them
toward the mottled bark, looking for the spot where Odin hung on the
tree, pierced by his own spear, for nine days listening and learning
the vanished dream-songs of the earth. The rumble of a passing truck,
too loud and too close in the afternoon air, reminds me how fragile,
how precarious is the solace of this place. Burns Bog is the largest
urban wilderness in North America. Its eventual fate -- as park,
industrial sprawl, or garbage dump -- lies hidden in a labyrinth of
divergent aims: community, business, government. The secret of its
preservation ripples beneath the surface of the well. In Norse myth,
Yggdrasil will be destroyed by a fiery sword during the final battle
of the world. The earth will descend into the primordial sea. Yet one
small forest will remain, Hodmimir, preserved by Lif and Lifthrasir,
whose names mean ``life'' and ``eager for life.'' They are the inheritors
of an unshadowed world rising from the waters of tumult. 

I trace my fingers over the trunk, lost in old tales: the twilight of
gods, a scorched and blackened tree, a luminous eye searching for
wisdom. And one forest, a delicate landscape snatched from ruin. A
droplet of clear sap hovers at the edge of a deep wrinkle in the bark.
I taste it: sweet, like sugarcane, but with a spreading warmth. 

The hinge of the world creaks around the trunk of this tree of storms.
The surrounding bog, with its forest ramparts hiding ghost cougars and
startled deer, is an archetype of all ancient and sacred places.
Through their preservation, we drink from the ancestral well. Long
draughts of memory, belonging, and sustenance. The trail curves back
from here, toward the service road and the tractor sunk in the mud. I
look up. The sun has drifted across the shell of the sky. Amber rays
lengthen along the trunk of the World Tree. I turn and follow the
path. The peat shivers as I move across it, pulsates with the rhythm
of my steps. A pair of sparrows flits through the underbrush. They
disappear behind a curtain of bracken ferns and emerge, darting and
jubilant, on the other side. Life, and eager for life.

\subsection{Research Project: Myths of the Primordial Waters}

Plato wrote that the past is like the wake behind a boat; it spreads,
and diminishes behind us, and merges with the surrounding sea. The
past rolls under and is gone.

We stand upon the foredeck of Plato's boat, gazing forward, cleaving
our path toward the future. Along the track of our traveling many
things are lost -- because we are always searching ahead, because the
wake is jostling and turbulent, because our craft is small and the
ocean is vast.

It is by means of this manner of journeying into the future that our
knowledge of ancient peoples is vanishingly small. We know a fair
amount about the last thousand years of our history, we surmise a
sketch of the thousand years before that -- and of the remote ages
before that, we know very little. Snatches, really, vignettes gathered
from scattered documents and fragmentary tales. For the great majority
of the history of modern humans -- a hundred thousand years, two
hundred thousand, no one knows -- we understand almost nothing. Along
our own coasts, which once were at lower altitude than they are now,
ancient villages lie hidden beneath the wake of passing boats above.

And yet, old stories have been handed down from that long, invisible
stretch of years: fables, epics, mythologies of archaic and unknown
origin. Among those ancient tales is a set of related motifs, from
many cultures, that tell of seafarers who found their way to distant
shores. In China, Polynesia, Japan, Egypt, Africa, Scandinavia -- in
most places bordered by the sea -- we find fantastic tales of oceanic
travel. On our own coasts -- in Haida Gwaii, and along the sheltered
eastern shore of Vancouver Island, and inland all the way to the
Kootenays -- similar stories are told of those who came long ago, and
lived upon the land, and vanished.

For at least a century, since archaeology and anthropology became
sciences based on hard evidence, such cultural tales have been
dismissed as folklore and wishful thinking. The evidence simply did
not support the stories. The timelines claimed by various cultures
seemed inconsistent with what was surmised about technologies and
methods from various historical and pre-historical periods. The ruins
of ancient sites could not be found (near Atlin, for example, or near
Telkwa, both sites where aboriginal tales describe cities of utmost
antiquity). The longevity of known sites could not be established from
existing data (the Nanaimo petroglyphs, for example). Eventually, the
scientific consensus was that the claims of myth were just that:
imagined tales, with no actual basis.

But within about the last decade, a wealth of new evidence challenges,
and will likely soon overturn, traditional scientific views concerning
human migration in the ancient world. The emerging data comes from
various fields: genetics, archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, and
the developing field of archaeo-astronomy. Working sometimes in
concert and other times in conflict, these fields are leading us
through a fundamental paradigm shift in our perspective of the past.

The history of science consistently confirms something we easily
forget: that most of our certainties will turn out to be wrong. What's
turning out to be wrong at the moment is our conception of the
peopling of the Americas. The standard theory -- the Bering land
bridge, ice-free corridors, southward migration -- has begun to give
way to a more nuanced and complex view involving multiple waves of
ancient immigrants arriving at different times and by disparate means.

Debates and developments within the scientific community typically
take place in closed meetings at universities and at conferences not
attended by the general public. But the conversation about ancient
migration has become very public since the 1996 discovery of a
skeleton known as Kennewick Man. He was found on the banks of the
Columbia River, in Washington State, by a pair of spectators watching
hydroplane races. Initially, local aboriginal groups claimed him as
one of their own; an ancestor, perhaps a fallen warrior from long ago.

But archaeologists who studied Kennewick Man found a curious thing: he
is not aboriginal. His remains are old -- approximately 9,300 years
old -- but he is not an ancestor of any current aboriginal population.
In fact, he's Asian. He may be an ancestor of modern Pacific
Islanders, or of the Ainu people of northeast Asia. In either case, he
traveled here more than ten thousand years ago, likely with a small
population of others like him who made their careful way inland and
across the Pacific Northwest.

Kennewick Man is not the only oddity of the ancient human landscape.
Many so-called anomalous remains and sites have been found in both
North and South America: Monte Verde, for example, in Chile, and the
entire collection of colossal stone remains in Mexico known as the
Olmec culture. Along British Columbia's Inside Passage, near the
Yuculta rapids, stone sculptors carved somber faces into twenty-six
granite boulders on the shore, more than at any other site on the
Pacific coast. The carvers are long gone, vanished but for these stone
traces of mystery.

As the number of anomalies has accumulated, the trajectory of the
scientific conversation has changed too: from dismissal, to caution,
to contention, and finally to a new consensus. That final, new
consensus has not yet fully emerged, but its basic elements are
already in place: many groups of migrating people came to North and
South America -- ten, twenty, perhaps as much as thirty thousand years
ago -- in separate and commingling waves of odyssey, exile, and
accident.

And how did they come? By boat.

Imagine those ancient mariners, navigating by the stars, uncertain of
their destination, traveling in what might have been open canoes or
out-rigged rafts or makeshift kayaks. No compass, no map, no
protection against the sea's indifference. Nothing but sheer guts and
necessity.

They came at different times and, no doubt, by varying means: from
Japan, Russia, Southeast Asia, Polynesia (likely from Europe, as
well). They established settlements here, lived upon the land for some
stretch of time, then disappeared. Perhaps they were subsumed into
existing or descendant groups. Perhaps most of them were wiped out by
an asteroid impact 13,000 years ago (as one recent theory suggests).
But no one knows. The descendants of the original, pre-migration
peoples still exist in Japan, Russia, and Polynesia. They are the
Ainu, the Jomon, the Polynesians; and they are still here, thousands
of years after small clusters of their people sailed across the sea.

The puzzle of the most archaic groups is deepened by the fact that sea
levels are now as much as 30 metres higher than they were 10,000 or
more years ago. Villages that once lay at the seaside are now long
immersed, swept by the amnesia of the waters, erased beneath Plato's
persistent wake.

However, anomalous underwater stone sites have been found in Japan,
Cuba, Malta, Egypt, and elsewhere. After the 2004 Indian Ocean
earthquake, stone artifacts from an ancient and fabled submerged city,
once dismissed by archaeologists as mythological, were washed up on
the beach by the force of the tsunami. These artifacts include
six-foot high statues of the head and shoulders of an elephant, a
horse in flight, and a reclining lion.

In Haida Gwaii, traditional myths tell of the ancient rise of the sea,
of ice floes moving across the land, of sudden and drastic upheavals
that transformed the islands. And those Haida myths also speak of an
earlier people, now gone, who inhabited that mystic place long ago,
and of whom nothing is now left but ghosts.

Those ghosts take many contemporary forms: the sea-wolf petroglyph
south of Nanaimo, the unique Christina Lake petroglyph, the funereal
mound at Keremeos, the persistent tales of the fabled city of
Dimlahamid in northern British Columbia, between the Bulkley and
Skeena rivers. And Kennewick Man, of course, who may have known, when
he was alive, the meaning of the stone sculptures at Yuculta, or might
himself have carved images into stones scattered across a river delta.
His people were here, after all -- in what is now Vancouver, and
Victoria, and inland by way of the rivers -- and the settlements of
our people today are laid over those of his people by thousands of
years of rainfall, wind, and memory.

And yet the ancient evidence swells, and spreads, and cannot be laid
to final rest: scattered human remains, colossal in their age;
Polynesian chicken bones found in Peru; genetic anomalies among
various cultural groups (the Scots, for example, may be descended from
ancient seafaring Egyptians).

The old boats are gone, of course, long undone by the alchemy of salt
water on wood. But the tales remain, and have not surrendered their
claims of authenticity. And now, finally, science is coming forward to
meet the mythological narrative. The new and shared story, woven
together by the threads of both science and cultural memory, is this:

No single people came first to the Americas, but instead many came, in
small sorties and great armadas, during a period of human history
about which we are profoundly ignorant. Before the Ice Age and after
it they arrived, and made homes for themselves, and left only the tiny
traces typical of the human story. Their cultures appeared and
vanished again (as our cultures will also).

These disparate groups were united by the sea, the great trackless
track that challenged and delivered them. The mariners of today are
the descendants, in spirit, of those early nomads who first harnessed
the wind. We pass over their graves, somewhere between the shore and
the deep water. Watch for that place -- 30 metres of depth -- and
recognize, as you pass over that line, the legacy you inherit: love of
the wide waters, the quest for adventure, the longing for what lies
over the horizon. These are the gifts of the vanished peoples, whom we
will never know except by the ways in which we are stirred, even now,
by their ancient dreams.
