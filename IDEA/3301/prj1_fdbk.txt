I enjoyed reading about your project, and it seems you enjoyed working on it. One of the great things about myth projects is that they encourage a kind of creative joyfulness. I also liked the ways in which you integrated your imaginative exploration with your personal universe. A good approach.

As for suggestions: think about the large and the small. It's an odd feature of myths that they derive larger scope by way of focus on small items. Think, for example, of Tolkien's ring, or of the stone shamir that was said to have built the first Hebrew Temple. Or -- one of my favorites -- the white feather weighed against the human heart in Egyptian mythology. Small things make big myths, and though we tend to think big when we think about myth, we should also think small.

Keep going. The most important thing in mythological creativity is the imagination, and you seem to be working on that nicely. Imagination is more important than (almost) anything else. And, as you continue with other projects, think about using the particular moments, symbols, or scenes as representations, in miniature, of the entire cosmos. Every myth is the universe condensed down into a single moment.

If you have questions, send them along.
