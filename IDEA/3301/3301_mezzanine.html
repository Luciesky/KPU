<p>The creative arts are powerful, ancient, and yet delicate practices. We work quietly, often in isolation, in tentative and mercurial moods. We revise, and turn back upon our own narratives, and wonder about the reception our work might meet in the world. Sometimes we hide manuscripts in drawers, or take deliberate action &mdash; as did Franz Kafka and Mahatma Gandhi &mdash; to prevent our creativity from making its way to an audience. Kafka and Gandhi were both unsuccessful in preventing their writings from being destroyed; but their impulse to do so, to keep hooded the hawk of their creativity, is common among artists of all stripes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure that we have, really, anything to say; or we are afraid that if our work is not well met we might ourselves be wounded. Or we believe, as did the ancient Egyptians, that words and images have their own life, for good or for ill, and that creativity is a means of seizing the power of the gods. This course attempts to explore this conversation &mdash; between the artist and the wider world &mdash; and to find ways of bringing our creativity safely out of hiding.</p>
<p>We will be exploring myth, and the strategic practices every writer and artist must learn in wrestling with narrative. Each of us will examine our strengths &mdash; the ways in which the natural mood and flavour of our creativity makes itself known &mdash; and our vulnerabilities as well: how we get stuck, or lazy, how we lost confidence and gain doubt. How we learn to shut down and hope the whole thing will go away.</p>
<p>This course is about making a claim for the fundamental right of storytelling. Within that context, we will explore the ancient practices of myth-making (particularly as regards family and culture), and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that is to say, the long tradition of myth-makers).</p>
<p>The threshold between fact and fiction (which is not the same as that between truth and lie) is one of the territories of myth. In this course we stake out that territory, inspecting the geology of its forms and ideals, finding our own individual places to homestead. Myth involves the search for truth, and fidelity to fact, yet also an awareness that truth and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do about it.</p>
<h2>The IDEA Skill Set</h2>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s most helpful to come at interdisciplinary creativity in terms of a skill set. Thinking and acting in an interdisciplinary way is really a matter of looking at the process of learning. Instead of focusing on the &ldquo;content&rdquo; we might ask questions about how we identify, interpret, create, and communicate this content. These are process questions. Below are some examples of the kinds of considerations we will explore during our process.</p>
<h3>Creating a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Question</h3>
<p>The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we&rsquo;re willing to accept as answers. What is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they &ldquo;work&rdquo; on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.</p>
<h3>Critical Thinking and Crap Detection</h3>
<p>We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem &ldquo;authoritative.&rdquo; Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we&rsquo;re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of &ldquo;facts&rdquo;? And what are facts, anyway?</p>
<h3>Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we&rsquo;re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?</p>
<h3>Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)</h3>
<p>Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?</p>
<h3>Working in a Group</h3>
<p>Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy group process:</p>
<ul>
<li>building trust and a culture of collaboration</li>
<li>attending to individual needs and the needs of the group</li>
<li>sharing responsibility</li>
<li>giving and receiving feedback</li>
<li>embracing and resolving minor conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of our class time will be spent in small and large groups exploring and developing these skills.</p>
<h3>Following Through on a Process</h3>
<p>Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don&rsquo;t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it&rsquo;s helpful to think about the ecocycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there&rsquo;s a spark that feels like it&rsquo;s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess around with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; eventually comes, perhaps after a long &ldquo;winter&rdquo;. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.</p>
<p>What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?</p>
<h3>Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation</h3>
<p>Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment &mdash; that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone &mdash; do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.</p>
<p>Self-assessment involves asking questions such about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?</p>
<h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
<p>The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creative writing and mythology are both interactive processes, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, composition, and practical assignments.</p>
<p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.</p>
<p>And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the foundation of all the arts and sciences.</p>
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>The class structure involves 14 sessions. These sessions will be balanced between presentations (by the instructor and students) academic material, group collaboration, and composition. The content for each session will evolve as the semester progresses. We will cover the following themes (though, perhaps not in the order listed below):</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>Three creative projects are required for this course: one composition, one non-literary creative work (painting, sculpture, craft, dance, etc.), and one documented cultural experience. These projects are opportunities for you to discover and explore the myths surrounding your own life and academic interests. We will discuss these projects in class.</p>
<p>Each project will include a written self-evaluation. The self-evaluation will include answers to the following questions (answers need not be itemized):</p>
<ul>
<li>What research did you do to prepare for this project? Research might include readings, investigative interviews, online searches, self-reflections, ruminations, and many other modalities.</li>
<li>What learning resources did you use? These might include books, articles, online resources, and so on.</li>
<li>Of the research and readings you undertook, what impressed you as being most interesting or relevant?</li>
<li>What kinds of experiments did you undertake with this project? What did you build, write, craft, or try? How did you spend your time, and how did it go?</li>
<li>What went well, where did you struggle, and how do you feel about the process you undertook during this project?</li>
<li>What were the best and worst moments of this project? What did you learn from these moments?</li>
<li>Are you proud of this project? Is it your best work? What grade would you give yourself?</li>
<li>How might you have improved this project, of your experience of it?</li>
<li>What did you learn about interdisciplinarity while working on this project?</li>
<li>What did you learn about yourself while working on this project?</li>
<li>What will you remember about this project in five years?</li>
<li>How does what you learned apply to your studies at Kwantlen and to your sense of your future direction?</li>
<li>What advice would you give to others who might be undertaking a similar project?</li>
<li>What did this project mean to you? What might it mean for others?</li>
<li>Do you plan to continue this project further, or to work on similar projects in the future?</li>
<li>You learned something crucial in this project which you won&rsquo;t discover for a while. Make a guess now about what that might be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the three projects is worth 25 per cent each of your final grade.</p>
<h3>Group Presentations</h3>
<p>Each student will be a member of several different peer groups; each peer group will present mini-presentations on various mythological motifs and characters. Class time will be given for preparing the presentations. The structure and content of the presentations will be discussed in class.</p>
<p>The central idea of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities to practice interdisciplinary thinking and expression. As such, the presentation should be interdisciplinary. Essentially, this means that you should try to use multiple presentation strategies and modalities. These might include (but are certainly not limited to) any of the following:</p>

</ul>
<p>Whenever possible (and workable), try to mix together multiple modalities into a single presentation. For example, you might ask the group to do some individual reflection using the modality of poetry, then create a series of movements based on the poetry, then work in small groups to talk about and share the process. Many configurations are possible. The trick is to choose an activity that you enjoy, then find a way to apply it to the content. Please do not create your presentations using only written and/or spoken materials. In other words, don&rsquo;t just stand up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic. Utilize the energy of the group. Remember that in interdisciplinary work divergences are valued as unique opportunities. So, feel free to experiment with activities and modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand but which might, upon experiment, yield surprising connections and results. Be playful. Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage with the process in novel and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The group presentations are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.</p>
<h3>Assessment for Group Presentations</h3>
<h4>Class and Instructor Assessment</h4>
<p>After each presentation, time will be set aside for class peers and the instructor to assess and give feedback on the presentations. Each group will design a rubric and questions for us to use in assessing each presentation. This feedback can sometimes be the most valuable part of the performance for everyone involved. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to see what worked, what landed with the audience and what didn&rsquo;t. This conversation can help the audience articulate struggles, questions and insights about what makes for an effective performance. By designing a rubric and questions for the audience to contemplate (either during or after the performance, depending on the goals and the presentation), you invite everyone to reflect on the nature and purpose of group sharing and performance.</p>
<h4>Self and Group Assessment</h4>
<p>This course utilizes experiential learning approaches which depend upon student involvement and active participation. Accordingly, the following criteria are used to evaluate overall participation and engagement in the group presentations and the class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>
<li>Willingness to speak up and to lead.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Willingness to collaborate with others.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Evaluation</h2>
<p>It is difficult (or at least different) to translate evaluation in an IDEA course into a letter grade. I prefer to speak about evaluation and assessment, not marks. Evaluation in this course takes several forms: I evaluate you, you evaluate me, you evaluate yourself, and you evaluate each other. I have started by describing a skill set. This is the focus of the evaluation. You need to demonstrate to yourself (and to me) that you have changed (that you have improved your skills) from the start of the course to the end of the course. It is that simple, in principle. Your level of improvement will translate to a letter grade using the following descriptors:</p>
<h3>A-/ A/ A+</h3>
<p>Has attained a high level of competency in all, or almost all, of the stated skill areas. This competency would allow the student to complete excellent interdisciplinary inquiry projects in any area. This would be recognizable by any facilitator and the peer group. The student is aware of any remaining area of skill vulnerability, has shown improvement in that area, has developed strategies for minimizing its adverse effects, and has a plan of action for personal and professional development.</p>
<h3>B-/ B/ B+</h3>
<p>Has attained a high level of competency in many (but not all) of the stated skill areas, or has attained moderate competency in all of the skill areas. This competency allows the completion of good inquiry projects. The student will have developed a plan of action for further development in those areas which need it.</p>
<h3>C- /C /C+</h3>
<p>Has attained a moderate level of competency in some of the stated skill areas or has attained a low level of competency in all of the skill areas. The student will recognize the deficiencies or concerns and will have discussed a plan of action to deal with the concerns.</p>
<h2>Learning Criteria</h2>
<p>The evidence for your learning will develop as a consequence of your involvement with many tools and learning contexts. The tools will include the development and utilization of criteria for evaluating yourself, your peers, and the works you read and create. The contexts include group work, your individual project, writing, presentations, and discussions. This course is a space for participating in a variety of formats and to work on those skills that need the most attention. Using the IDEA skill set as a guide, I will ask you to propose a grade for each individual project. We will then negotiate a grade that seems fitting, based on the evidence, using the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to the development of self-awareness.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I feeling right now?</li>
<li>What am I thinking right now?</li>
<li>Why am I reacting in this particular way?</li>
<li>What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?</li>
<li>Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?</li>
<li>When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?</li>
<li>In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you. At the very least, you might wish to consider what you are currently working on in your life, in which direction your attention is drawn, into which of the innumerable themes of human nature you are now called to delve.</p>
<p>In my role as your instructor, I will be paying attention to how thoughtful you are in examining and responding to questions like those in the lists above. I will not be analyzing you, but rather noticing what kinds of things you do, what your reactions are to various situations. My goal in observing your behaviors and interacting with you is to assist you in developing greater self-awareness (and, by extension, greater empathy, creativity, and character).</p>
<p>I will use the lists above, as well as the assessment criteria listed for each assignment, to assess your overall participation in the course. I will not be evaluating your level of self-awareness but rather your openness to the process of developing your self-awareness.</p>
