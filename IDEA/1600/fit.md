### Course Acronym, Number, and Title

IDEA 1600, Drumming, Percussion, and Creative Music-Making in the Community

### Brief Description of Course


Learners will explore drumming, percussion, and creative music-making within an expressive arts context. They will develop music performance skills, explore the practices of percussion-oriented communal music-making, and will participate in performances with communities within and beyond KPU.

### Program Fit

This course fulfills a long-standing initiative within IDEA to provide curriculum specifically focused on expressive arts percussion and music-making. The IDEA steering committee has identified performance curriculum as a priority, IDEA developers have been working toward drumming and percussion curriculum for some time, and learners have been requesting this kind of course since the inception of IDEA.

There is no similar course at KPU.

No prerequisites will be required.

### Faculty and Institutional Fit

This course utilizes specific modalities such as inquiry-based curriculum, reflective scholarship, intensive interaction, and interdisciplinarity. These approaches are all listed in the KPU Academic Plan as being foundational priorities. Additionally, the Academic Plan highlights the importance of values such as global citizenship, inspiration, compassion, imagination, and personal growth. These values are core elements of this course and of the IDEA philosophy in general. The Academic Plan further emphasizes skills such as effective communication, openness to diversity and inclusion, and creative and critical thinking. Again, these are all integral to the course and to the IDEA process. The broad goals articulated for KPU in the Academic Plan are embodied by this course and are reflected in the core processes and outcomes of the curriculum.

To illustrate the correlation between the course outcomes and the KPU Academic Plan, we have emphasized (below) the specific areas in which the learning outcomes for this course are aligned precisely with the KPU Academic Plan.

* _Explore and reflect upon_ musical performance experiences as opportunities for _developing citizenship, community, engagement, the creative imagination, and a critical sensibility_

* Utilize the context of _mentorship_ and the activities of expressive arts performance to achieve _personal growth_

* Interpret and apply _diverse traditions_ of music performance, particularly those based upon or connected to non-Western practices

* Develop the _creative imagination_ through performance, _mentorship_, and _community engagement_

* Improve skills of _communicating effectively_ in speaking, listening, writing, and performing

* _Join and contribute to_ an expressive arts _community_

* Create _interdisciplinary creative projects_ using strategies developed through exposure to a performance-based learning environment

We find similar correlations when we examine the KPU Strategic Plan. The core vision of the Strategic Plan is as follows, with emphasis added where the language matches the outcomes of the course under review:

* _Inspiring_ educators

* All _learners engaging in campus and community life_

* _Open and creative learning environments_

* _Relevant scholarship_ and research

* Authentic _external and internal relationships_

The Strategic Plan goes on to describe the importance of distinctive programming, innovative teaching and learning, experiential learning, enriched student experience, and purposeful community engagement. We have illustrated (below) how each of these core goals for KPU matches a core outcome for this course.

* _Distinctive programming_ corresponds to the unique performance and community-based curriculum of the course.

* _Innovative teaching and learning_ corresponds to the context of mentorship, creativity, and community engagement in the course.

* _Experiential learning_ corresponds to the learning environment of IDEA, which is entirely experiential.

* _Enriched student experience_ corresponds to the experiential learning environment focused on creativity, mentorship, engagement, and personal growth.

* _Purposeful community engagement_ corresponds to performances in the community (by the class) and a community of learning constructed by the learners (in the class).

The Arts Academic Plan is aligned with the KPU Academic and Strategic Plans, and we therefore see similar correlations in values, approaches, and goals. For example, the Arts Academic Plan specifically emphasizes goals such as the enhancement of experiential learning, the wider adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, the importance of preparing learners for global citizenship, and the crucial role of mentorship. All of these broad goals are specifically articulated in the course outline.

There is a high degree of symmetry between the stated goals of KPU, on many levels, and the articulated goals of this course. We believe that this course embodies, in a very fundamental way, the kind of institution that KPU has said it wants to be.

### Evidence of Demand

There is strong demand for this course from current learners at KPU. Every semester, the IDEA program engages in consultation with learners about program development (as IDEA is built by learners as well as faculty). In each of the last three iterations of this consultation (over the last three semesters), percussion, drumming, and creative music-making curriculum has been near the top of the list of requested new courses.

Also, at IDEA music-making events in the Conference Centre (several such events are offered each semester), many KPU learners who are not enrolled in IDEA courses stop by, ask to join these events, and almost always ask if they can do more. These requests are a clear indication that many KPU learners seek precisely the kinds of experiences offered by this course.

The IDEA steering committee has also highlighted performance curriculum as a main priority. Such curriculum fills a current gap in our offering. The discipline of Expressive Arts utilizes a suite of modalities that typically includes art, music, movement, writing, storytelling, craft, nature experience, drama improvisation, and theatre performance. At the moment, while our course activities often include music-making, we do not yet offer a specific course in community music-making facilitated by a professional musician.

### Consultation

We have consulted learners, with the IDEA development group, and with faculty colleagues. All are supportive of this initiative.

Once the course is approved, we will also meet with high school music teachers to forge a working relationship that will allow us to perform for high schools. This initiative will be facilitated by the fact that many of the KPU students enrolled in the course will have taken music at local high schools. In addition, once we have developed performance material appropriate for elementary school students, we will approach elementary schools with the goal of performing for them.

### Cross- or Interdisciplinary Potential

IDEA is, by definition and core purpose, an interdisciplinary initiative. (The “I” in IDEA stands for Interdisciplinary.) Accordingly, this course will be interdisciplinary. Moreover, the instructor for this course will be developing relationships with learners and faculty in other departments with the goal of offering performances to enhance the KPU community.

Finally, the study of percussion, drumming, and creative music-making is inherently interdisciplinary. Learners will explore material from various cultures and time periods, often integrating different disciplinary and cultural approaches.

### Additional Considerations

We will need to utilize the Conference Centres (in Richmond and Surrey) as well as the Langley theatre for performances.

Some performances may be held off campus. These will be similar to regular field trips and do not require special consultations in risk management.
