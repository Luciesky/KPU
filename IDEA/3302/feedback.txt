Great job on the group design project. This group sounds interesting and quite doable. Groups like these tend to go well, and they also help participants to learn some very useful self-awareness skills (especially as they interact with one another). If you were to actually offer this group, much would depend on experimentation and practice. It would probably take two or three tries to figure out how to manage the various challenges and themes. But, as I said, it's all quite doable.

I have enjoyed your contributions to the class overall and to the collective group experience we built in the classroom. You showed strong commitment, energy, and enthusiasm, and that's great to see.

Overall, you've done very well: A

Keep it up.

Cheers.
