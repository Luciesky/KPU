<h1 id="proposed-field-sites">Proposed Field Sites</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Ecology Around the Campus</p>
<p>Explore the webs of connection and consider human impacts (positive and negative).</p>
<p>Sciences angle: food webs, invasive species, nutrient cycling, plant ID.</p>
<p>Arts angle: patterns and symmetry, mindfulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Boundary Bay (Tides and Transitions)</p>
<p>Explore the in-between places, the estuary and intertidal zones. How do organisms such as the screw snail, lugworm and ghost shrimp survive in this chaotic environment? How do we cope during times of change? Consider the influence of the moon.</p>
<p>Sciences angle: intertidal zone, biodiversity, tides and lunar cycles.</p>
<p>Arts angle: process and product, transitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Watershed Park (A Walk/Run in the Woods)</p>
<p>Explore the rich tapestry of the forest. Listen for birdsong. Every tree has a story to tell in its rings, leaves and symbolism. What do they tell us? Stand still, meditate, walk slowly, go for a run. Experience yourself in ecological immersion.</p>
<p>Sciences angle: dendrochronology, bird language, forest ecology (abiotic and biotic factors, indicator species, nurse logs, adaptations, disturbances, etc).</p>
<p>Arts angle: folklore, mythology, aesthetic experience, creativity.</p></li>
<li><p>Cougar Creek (The River of Time)</p>
<p>Follow the river and be mindful the the journey. Water is central to life, a simple compound of hydrogen and oxygen and yet amazingly unique in its properties to sustain life.</p>
<p>Sciences angle: limnology (biological, geological, chemical, and physical characteristics of the river), water cycle, water quality (EPT) index.</p>
<p>Arts angle: creative inspiration, reflection, finding purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Delta Nature Reserve (Bogged Down)</p>
<p>Burns Bog is a globally unique ecosystem, and one of the largest undeveloped urban wilderness areas in North America. An immense amount of carbon dioxide is trapped within this raised peat bog. What happens when we get stuck? How can we shift things?</p>
<p>Sciences angle: unique flora and fauna, carbon cycle, climate change, sustainability.</p>
<p>Arts angle: creativity, inspiration, personal growth, myth and culture.</p></li>
<li><p>Tynehead Fish Hatchery (Life and Death)</p>
<p>Understand how a hatchery works. Tynehead is run entirely by volunteers. Perhaps have the opportunity to participate in an egg take.</p>
<p>Sciences angle: life cycle (fish), fish biology, sustainability.</p>
<p>Arts angle: life cycle (human), death and birth in creativity and art, connection to food.</p></li>
<li><p>Vancouver Aquarium</p>
<p>Explore the fantastic marine environments at the aquarium.</p>
<p>Sciences angle: marine biology, oceanography, evolution, sustainability.</p>
<p>Arts angle: creative inspiration, colour and texture, movement.</p></li>

<p>Reifel Bird Sanctuary, Serpentine Fen, bird banding at Colony Farm (Saturdays only), Mountain View Conservation Centre (tours only; unique animals both native and exotic), Campbell Valley Park, Derby Reach Park, Tynehead Park, farmer’s market, walk along power line trail near Kwantlen.</p></li>
