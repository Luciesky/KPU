### Course Acronym, Number, and Title

IDEA 2200, Community Performance and Theatre Exploration

### Brief Description of Course

Learners will explore performance and theatre within an expressive arts context. They will develop performance skills and will present theatre productions to various communities within and beyond KPU.

### Program Fit

This course fulfills a long-standing initiative within IDEA to provide curriculum specifically focused on expressive arts performance. The IDEA steering committee has identified performance curriculum as a priority, IDEA developers have been working toward performance curriculum for some time, and learners have been requesting this kind of course since the inception of IDEA.

There is no similar course at KPU.

One prerequisite will be required: IDEA 1100. This is to ensure that learners are capable — before enrolling in the performance course — of participating successfully in the IDEA learning environment. 

### Faculty and Institutional Fit

This course utilizes specific modalities such as inquiry-based curriculum, reflective scholarship, intensive interaction, and interdisciplinarity. These approaches are all listed in the KPU Academic Plan as being foundational priorities. Additionally, the Academic Plan highlights the importance of values such as global citizenship, inspiration, compassion, imagination, and personal growth. These values are core elements of this course and of the IDEA philosophy in general. The Academic Plan further emphasizes skills such as effective communication, openness to diversity and inclusion, and creative and critical thinking. Again, these are all integral to the course and to the IDEA process. The broad goals articulated for KPU in the Academic Plan are embodied by this course and are reflected in the core processes and outcomes of the curriculum.

To illustrate the correlation between the course outcomes and the KPU Academic Plan, we have emphasized (below) the specific areas in which the learning outcomes for this course are aligned precisely with the KPU Academic Plan.

* _Explore and reflect upon_ performance and theatre experiences as opportunities for _developing the creative imagination, a critical sensibility, citizenship, and community engagement_

* Utilize the context of _mentorship_ and the activities of expressive arts performance to achieve _personal growth_

Interpret and apply _diverse traditions_ of performance and theatre

Develop the _creative imagination_ through performance, _mentorship_, and _community engagement_

* Improve skills of _communicating effectively_ in speaking, listening, writing, and performing

* _Join and contribute to_ an expressive arts _community_

* Create _interdisciplinary creative projects_ using strategies developed through exposure to a performance-based learning environment

We find similar correlations when we examine the KPU Strategic Plan. The core vision of the Strategic Plan is as follows, with emphasis added where the language matches the outcomes of the course under review:

* _Inspiring_ educators

* All _learners engaging in campus and community life_

* _Open and creative learning environments_

* _Relevant scholarship_ and research

* Authentic _external and internal relationships_

The Strategic Plan goes on to describe the importance of distinctive programming, innovative teaching and learning, experiential learning, enriched student experience, and purposeful community engagement. We have illustrated (below) how each of these core goals for KPU matches a core outcome for this course.

* Distinctive programming = Unique performance-based curriculum

* Innovative teaching and learning = Context of mentorship, creativity, and community engagement

* Experiential learning = Learning environment of IDEA (which is entirely experiential)

* Enriched student experience = Experiential learning environment focused on creativity, mentorship, engagement, and personal growth

* Purposeful community engagement = Performances in the community and a learning community within the class.

The Arts Academic Plan is aligned with the KPU Academic and Strategic Plans, and we therefore see similar correlations in values, approaches, and goals. For example, the Arts Academic Plan specifically emphasizes goals such as the enhancement of experiential learning, the wider adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, the importance of preparing learners for global citizenship, and the crucial role of mentorship. All of these broad goals are specifically articulated in the course outline.

There is a high degree of symmetry between the stated goals of KPU, on many levels, and the articulated goals of this course. We believe that this course embodies, in a very fundamental way, the kind of institution that KPU has said it wants to be.
