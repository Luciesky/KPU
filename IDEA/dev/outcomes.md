Ground
------

### Learning for the Whole Person.

### Your life. Your learning. Your way.

Foundation
----------

* Self-awareness (what we know about ourselves)
* Empathy (how we work with and learn from others)
* Character (how we use our self-awareness and empathy in the world)

Structure
---------

* Creative, integrative, and engaged teaching and learning for the whole person.
* Built by learners and for learners.
* Focused on personal development, community engagement, and mentorship.

Design
------

* Anything added dilutes everything else. (The program should be clear and simple.)
* Practicality beats purity. (Skills are more important than theories.)
* Half measures are as bad as nothing at all. (We should reach for what we want.)
* Simple is better than complex. (Pathways and processes should be straightforward.)
* Complex is better than complicated. (When complexities are required, they should be simple.)
* Sparse is better than dense. (We prefer plain language over academic-speak.)
* Flow is important. (Flow mirrors life.)
* Humans make this. (Our emphasis is on relationship and interaction.)

Craft
------

* The community of learners creates the environment of learning.
* Self-awareness is built through personal development.
* Empathy is built through community engagement.
* Character is built through mentorship.

Community
---------

* Learning is not education. (Learning is personal; education is social.)
* Education is not curriculum. (Education is a process; curriculum is a product.)
* Curriculum is not knowledge. (Curriculum is a map; knowledge is the territory.)
* Knowledge is not wisdom. (Knowledge is personal; wisdom is cultural.)
* Wisdom is not teaching. (Wisdom is cultural; teaching is personal.)
* Teaching is not learning. (Teaching is about the teacher; learning is about the learner.)
