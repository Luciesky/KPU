Foundation

Structure

Design
------

* Anything added dilutes everything else. (The program should be clear and simple.)
* Practicality beats purity. (Skills are more important than theories.)
* Half measures are as bad as nothing at all. (We should reach for what we want.)
* Simple is better than complex. (Pathways and processes should be straightforward.)
* Complex is better than complicated. (When complexities are required, they should be simple.)
* Sparse is better than dense. (We prefer plain language over academic-speak.)
* Flow is important. (Flow mirrors life.)
