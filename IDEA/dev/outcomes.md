The Skill Set
-------------

### Creating a “Good” Question

The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we’re willing to accept as answers. What is a “good” question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they “work” on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.

#### Condensed version

* Creating effective questions for a broad range of inquiry.


### Critical Thinking and Crap Detection

We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem “authoritative.” Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we’re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of “facts”? And what are facts, anyway?

### Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources

Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we’re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?

### Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)

Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?

### Working in a Group

Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy group process:

* building trust and a culture of collaboration
* attending to individual needs and the needs of the group
* sharing responsibility
* giving and receiving feedback
* embracing and resolving minor conflicts

### Following Through on a Process

Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don’t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it’s helpful to think about the ecocycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there’s a spark that feels like it’s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess around with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. “Spring” eventually comes, perhaps after a long “winter”. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.

What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?

### Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation

Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment — that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone — do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.

Self-assessment involves asking questions about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?
