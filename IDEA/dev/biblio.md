Ambrose, S. A., Bridges, M.W., Dipietro,, M., Lovett, M.C., & Norman, M.K. (2010). *How learning works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching*. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. 

Discusses general principles for teaching excellence, including: bridging teaching and learning; how prior knowledge affects learning; the implications of how students organize knowledge; what motivates students; how students develop mastery; what kinds of practice and feedback enhance learning; why course climates matters; and how to encourage self-direction. There is also an extensive set of appendices, with many examples. *Appendix C: What are Rubrics and How Can We Use Them?* is especially helpful for our purposes.

Kennedy, D., Hyland, A., & Ryan, N. (2006). *Writing and using learning outcomes: A practical guide*. In Froment, E., Kohler, J., Purser, L., & Wilson, L. (Eds). *EUA Bologna Handbook — Making Bologna Work*. Berlin, Germany: Raabe Verlag.

This chapter of the Bologna Process implemtation guide discusses considerations for creating effective learning outcomes in programs and courses that utlize the Bologna process. The text explores the implications of a core approach: *… The principal question asked of the student or the graduate will therefore
no longer be “what did you do to obtain your degree?” but rather “what can you do now that you have obtained your degree?” (Purser, Council of Europe, 2003).

Campbell, G. (2013). *The single most consequential thing we do in universities: a case study in teaching assessment to new academics*. In Salter, D. J. (Ed), *Cases on quality teaching practices in higher education*. Hershey, PA: IGI Global.

Discusses a general approach to thinking purposefully about assessment.

Courneya, C. A. (2013). *White coat warm heART*. In Salter, D. J. (Ed), *Cases on quality teaching practices in higher education*. Hershey, PA: IGI Global.
  
Discusses the uses of art and art-making approaches during professional medical identity formation. Shows several examples of successful learner-centered, art-based approaches.

Pascarella, E., & Terenzini, P. (1977). *Patterns of student-faculty informal interaction beyond the classroom and voluntary freshman attrition*. Journal of Higher Education, 5, 540–552. 

Pascarella, E., & Terenzini, P. (1991). *How college affects students: Findings
and insights from twenty years of research*. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

Pascarella, E. T., & Terenzini, P. T. (2005). *How college affects students: A
third decade of research*. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.
 
All three of the above explore the social and emotional world of learners. The 1991 work shows that social and emotional gains made by students during their time at university are considerably greater than their intellectual gains. This work also shows the importance of course climate in contributing to learner success. The 1997 work examines the importance of relationship-building between faculty and learners. The 2005 work discusses student challenges with self-management.

Felton, P., & Finley, A. (2013). *Motivating teaching excellence: Lessons from U.S. teaching awards*. In Salter, D.J. (Ed.), *Cases in Quality Teaching Practices in Higher Education*. Hershey, PA: IGI Global.

Discusses opportunities and challenges for motivating learning innovation and excellence among faculty.

Rogdgers, C. *Seeing student learning; teacher change and the role of reflection.* Harvard Educational Review, Summer 2002, 230—252.

Discusses the importance of practitioner reflection and describes a four-phase reflective cylce that the author uses in her professional development work with teachers. Rodgers argues that “supportive and disciplined reflective communities of teachers can help teachers understand that their students’ learning is central, and that their own teaching is subordinate to and in service of that goal.”
