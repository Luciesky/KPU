KPU Strategic Plan
==================

So Far, so Fast
---------------

Our story began in 1981 with Kwantlen College inheriting two
temporary campuses and a few students from Douglas College.
Expansion was rapid as Kwantlen grew to serve the needs
of the burgeoning population south of the Fraser River.
Between 1988 and 1994, new campuses opened in Surrey
(1990), Richmond (1992), and Langley (1993). By Spring 1994,
Kwantlen had 8,444 students and 923 employees.

A name and status change in 1995 created Kwantlen
University College, allowing the institution to award degrees in
applied fields of study. Kwantlen’s first baccalaureate degrees
were awarded in 1997. By 2002, Kwantlen had eight applied
baccalaureate programs and permission to begin granting
Bachelor of Arts degrees.

The Cloverdale Trades and Technology campus opened in
2007 with state-of-the-art facilities housed in the first LEED
gold certified building in the City of Surrey.
In 2008, we became Kwantlen Polytechnic University. At the first
convocation ceremony as a university in 2009, KPU awarded
2,283 credentials, 529 of them baccalaureate degrees.

KPU’s academic researchers have already received national
recognition. In 2009, KPU received funding from the Canadian
Foundation for Innovation and the B.C. Knowledge Development Fund
enabling the Institute for Sustainable Horticulture to establish a
leading-edge research facility. The Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council (SSHRC) in 2009 awarded KPU a CURA grant, which
recognizes community-based innovative research, to study prevention of
gang membership. In 2013, KPU received eligibility for the prestigious
Canada Research Chairs (CRC). The first CRC Tier II award, five-year
renewable, was granted to support a Chair in Lifespan Cognition.

In 2010, KPU proudly opened the Aboriginal Gathering Place, which
supports social and educational activities and recognizes the
important contributions of all Aboriginal Nations to this region.

Donor support for KPU has been strong. Significant gifts include a
$1-million donation from Coast Capital Savings in 2009. In 2010, KPU
received a donation of $2.5 million from B.C. philanthropist Irving
K. Barber to establish an endowment to facilitate students’ transition
to university.

In 2012, KPU received a $12-million gift from Chip and
Shannon Wilson and lululemon athletica to build a new School of
Design. The gift was matched by the provincial government and KPU to
create a $36-million facility that will inspire innovation and
creativity.

As we unveil KPU’s bold new vision in this, our first
strategic plan as a polytechnic university, KPU has over 19,500
students and is one of the region’s largest employers, with close to
1,500 employees.

In 2013, KPU is a new model of undergraduate university that combines
superior instruction, learning support, faculty and student research,
and community relations to meet our communities’ needs for leaders,
thinkers, and doers.

Message from the President
--------------------------

KPU’s Strategic Plan: VISION 2018 is the result of nine
months of discussions both internally and with KPU’s external
communities. It builds upon related work undertaken over the
past few years and on our ongoing analysis of the environment
in which we operate.

evolution of our region. KPU will be sharing the progress
towards our vision openly and regularly, and thereby generate
the momentum needed for the University and our
communities to mutually support each other, and to grow
and thrive together.

Our vision and goals have been tested against the
expectations of the communities we serve and against
scenarios for the future of our region and our province.
We believe that our three themes of Quality, Relevance,
and Reputation capture both the challenge and the
opportunity that present themselves to KPU.

VISION 2018 is very bold. It asks a lot of our employees, and it
depends on the trust of our students, alumni, and community
leaders. Given the inadequate funding KPU receives in relation
to our expansive mandate, it would be easy to be cynical;
cynicism, however, has not been evident in any of the events
and discussions we have undertaken thus far in this process.

By improving the outcomes of our graduates through
teaching innovation and scholarship, and by creating
synergies as an organization to improve our effectiveness,
KPU will demonstrate progress towards our vision as the
leading institution of its kind in Canada and beyond.

The optimism at KPU is palpable, and capitalizing on
this energy to fuel the work ahead is a critical factor for
our success.

By ensuring that all programs allow students to link their
studies to work and to local and global communities, and
by engaging in applied research, we can demonstrate our
relevance. Since we live in a growing region that has fewer
post-secondary spaces per capita than it should, KPU must
also be prepared to grow in a manner that supports the social,
cultural, and economic development of our communities.

We are up for the challenge. Prepare to be amazed!

KPU’s Academic Plan 2013-2018: A Preview
----------------------------------------

KPU’s Academic Plan 2013-2018 will be a comprehensive
and integrated set of university-wide priorities that guide all
aspects of the academic endeavour.

The plan defines the academic character of KPU as a unique
B.C. post-secondary institution — a polytechnic university with
a teaching focus — and re-affirms values and commitments
built over 30 years, all within the context of KPU’s Strategic
Plan: VISION 2018. It provides a coherent description of KPU’s
culture of scholarship and its relationship with teaching
and learning.

The academic plan steers operational decisions and resource
allocation. Driven by department and Faculty input, the
academic plan is a living document that will evolve with
on-going consultation.

The objectives of KPU’s Academic Plan 2013-2018 are to:

* Advance the excellence of the student learning experience

* Enhance and promote student engagement in order to support students’
attainment of their academic goals

* Articulate the direction of educational programming and purposeful
community engagement

* Build university capacity, in particular, revenue, enrolment, and
KPU’s academic reputation

A set of unifying Academic Foundations draws together
the seven Faculty plans, student support area functions,
and university-wide initiatives expressed as a series of
commitments to students about the nature of their experience
at KPU. The University makes a commitment to:

##### Distinctive Programming

KPU students will choose from a wide range of diverse,
innovative, and high-quality programs that reflect KPU’s
polytechnic mandate, providing students with unique
learning opportunities. Different entry points, credential
levels, and delivery options will make KPU programs more
accessible to a wide range of learners.

##### Innovative Teaching and Learning

KPU students will experience an inclusive, challenging,
and dynamic learning environment that promotes creative
and critical thinking. Programs will engage students,
enhancing their learning using multiple teaching methods,
and drawing on appropriate technologies.

##### Well-defined Learning Outcomes
KPU students will consolidate and apply their learning
in a variety of contexts to validate their mastery of stated
learning outcomes.

##### Experiential Learning

KPU students will integrate theory with practice, applying
their learning through experiential opportunities available in
all KPU programs.

##### Enriched Student Experience

KPU students will grow as communicators, citizens,
and community leaders. KPU students will encounter a
supportive and collaborative learning environment
inside and outside the classroom. This experience
will encourage them to develop personally as well as
intellectually, to forge collegial relationships, and to
understand and appreciate local and global societies
and cultures.

##### Purposeful Community Engagement

By engaging with our diverse internal, regional,
and global communities, KPU students will have
opportunities to develop a rich understanding of
the complex social, environmental, economic, and
political issues that impact humanity.

KPU’s Academic Plan 2013-2018 will also have sections that speak to
the role of faculty and staff, distinct campus identities, and
community engagement strategies. The academic plan does not seek to
impose particular practices, but to articulate a broad set of
principles, priorities, and recommendations for the University. Key
decisions about curricula and programs will be made by the Faculties,
schools, and departments, and approved by Senate.

For September 2013, KPU’s Academic Plan 2013-2018 will set key
priorities for 2013-14 in the context of the overall five-year
directions. By June 2014, other plans prompted by VISION 2018 will
address:

* Engaging KPU in teaching and learning, including the role
of instructional technologies that will extend and enrich the
learning environment

* Establishing KPU’s profile and directions in research
and scholarship

* Developing a comprehensive strategic enrolment
management plan for KPU’s learner FTE growth strategy

* Expanding continuing and professional education

* Enhancing internationalization to develop better understanding of
global challenges and citizenship

These plans will then be integrated into the ongoing academic planning
process, in keeping with KPU’s commitment to open and transparent
integrated planning.

Planning Process
----------------

KPU embarked on its strategic planning process with a commitment to
developing a plan that was rooted in the principles of inclusivity and
engagement. Recognizing that a unified voice is a strong and
captivating voice, the process was designed to hear the voice of
everyone at KPU. This strategic plan is built on work done for
Creating Our Future in 2007-2008 and other planning initiatives at KPU
in recent years.
