Arts Academic Plan, 2013
========================

Planning for the Arts Academic Plan began in the Fall of 2012, with discussions of the process by
which to solicit faculty feedback being initiated from the Dean’s Office and subsequently
including the Arts Standing Committee on Academic Planning and Priorities (APP)*. One set of
questions was designed for faculty, and another set for departments. Three faculty feedback
forums were held at the end of January 2013, one in Richmond campus and two on the Surrey
campus. Approximately 40 faculty members attended these forums, and notes were taken on
flipcharts and laptops. A Sharepoint site was also developed as a forum for faculty feedback.
The departmental questions were sent to Chairs for discussions with their faculty, and we
received responses from eight departments. All faculty and departmental feedback was
compiled into themes, with the Dean’s Leadership team† and the Chair of APP developing the
first draft, and the APP committee shaping and re-wording the plan. The draft was then sent to
all Arts faculty and posted on Sharepoint for feedback. The Arts Academic Plan was approved by
Arts APP on March 15, 2013, and will be considered by the Arts Faculty Council on March 22,
2013.

This Academic Plan sets out a vision for the Faculty of Arts for the next five years, to 2018. As
we look to the future, we recognize the strengths of our current practices—for example, small
class sizes and departmental autonomy. At the same time, we realize that the educational and
demographic contexts in which we work are changing, and KPU is currently developing
institution-wide Strategic and Academic Plans intended to help us adapt and flourish within this
new environment. Several of the goals we have identified take into consideration the role Arts
could play in realizing these broader institutional aims. While valuing our past successes, we
embrace a desire to be flexible and agile so as to meet the emergent needs of our communities,
and to remain a leader in KPU's future academic development.

The goals outlined below are thematically grouped, but do not reflect an order of priority.

Goals
-----

### Enhance experiential and applied learning opportunities

ARTS will meet KPU's polytechnic mandate and the vision of our Strategic Plan through
the development and recognition of experiential and applied learning requirements for
all students in Arts programs. These may include, but are not limited to, service
learning, field schools (local and international), practica, prior learning assessment
(PLA), student research, and/or co-op designations.

### Define and build interdisciplinarity in Arts

ARTS will strike a Faculty-wide working group to assess current practices, develop a
definition, and propose strategies for existing and potential interdisciplinary programs
and courses in Arts. These may include, but are not limited to, ARTS 101, first year
interdisciplinary courses, cross-departmental team-teaching, a multi-disciplinary
academic writing course, a common research methods course, arts-themed/topic
course(s), shared texts across disciplines, expansion of cross listing of courses, and
review of the B.A. framework and the use of the B.A. General Studies.

### Foster internationalization

ARTS will meet KPU's strategic goal of preparing students for global citizenship through
welcoming more international students into the Faculty and building the global
awareness and competencies of domestic students. Possible strategies include, but are
not limited to, the creation of accessible programming for international students,
incorporation of global considerations in courses across our programs, and the
development of a Global Competencies Certificate.

### Facilitate Aboriginal learners' success

As KPU is committed to working with Aboriginal communities to develop appropriate
educational pathways and programs to facilitate Aboriginal learners’ success, ARTS will
work to augment the inclusion of indigenous peoples' issues and perspectives in
curricula, promote the recognition of the diversities of Canadian societies and histories
throughout our programs, encourage Aboriginal awareness and inquiries in our research
and scholarship, and explore the possibility of offering indigenous languages courses.

### Cultivate flexibility in educational/course offerings

ARTS will develop alternative scheduling and delivery patterns to enhance the flexibility
of our course and/or program offerings, e.g. evening classes, full summer semester of
courses, weekend classes, condensed and alternative condensed courses, and/or
blended and online courses.

### Improve student learning outcomes and success

ARTS will focus on improving student learning outcomes and success through
enhancement of learning support services; assessment of current placement,
completion and retention strategies; expansion of student advising resources and
activities; and development of new academic policies such as the completion of the 6
credits of ENGL in the first 60 credits of the B.A. degree.

### Broaden integration of technology

ARTS will aim to increase our online and blended offerings across Arts departments and
programs, and expand the use of technology in all areas of Faculty engagement. We will
make use of institutional opportunities and increased infrastructure support for current
faculty and staff to develop the skills base to support these offerings and enhance all
areas of faculty work-life and student/institutional interface.

### Develop distinct new credentials

ARTS commits to the development of innovative and responsive new
credentials in three key revenue-generating areas: post-baccalaureate
studies, continuing and professional studies, and programs for
international students. Other new credential opportunities may include
interdisciplinary and/or applied minors, degree completion programs,
and the development of a Master of Arts in Integrated
Studies. Additionally, new learning opportunities within our Faculty
may emerge through adjacent programming such as summer camps,
professional development opportunities for teachers, and weekend
workshops.

### Nurture a culture of mentorship

ARTS will seek opportunities to expand peer and institutional
mentorship for and among students, alumni, faculty, staff, and
administrators, e.g. lower and upper level student peer mentorship,
chair mentorship, new faculty mentorship, service mentorship for
faculty, teaching mentorship.

### Promote research and the scholarship of teaching and learning

ARTS will support faculty in their quest for more research funding and
opportunities for scholarly engagement. We will advocate for
meaningful change in the work environment for those faculty engaged in
research and strive to foster a culture of research and engagement in
the scholarship of teaching and learning. ARTS will develop more
opportunities for engaging students in significant research projects.

### Encourage a service active faculty

Given that all faculty benefit from participating in institutional
service at departmental, Faculty, university and external levels, ARTS
will explore the development of more variety and equity in service
opportunities.

### Continue community building and Arts profile-raising

ARTS will strengthen our sense of Faculty identity, our position in
the University, and our links to external post-secondary and community
partners. Initiatives may include:

* developing and promoting Arts teaching, service, research celebrations and
awards;
* organizing Arts lecture series;
* strategizing Arts conference opportunities;
* hosting Arts holiday and social gatherings;
* supplementing Faculty General Meetings to include discussions of teaching
  and course delivery across the Arts;
* working with KPU Marketing to promote Arts programming and events;
* working with the Director of Space Administration and facilities to improve
  Arts’ physical presence at KPU;
* fostering connections with Arts alumni;
* working with other institutions to become a stronger receiving institution;
* collaborating with other institutions to broaden our programming and
  scholarship, such as offering shared field schools and conferences.

### Streamline decision-making processes

As an institution we have a pronounced need to be relevant, current,
and nimble in our ability to respond to emerging needs of students,
community, and industry in our region and beyond. ARTS will advocate
for reform and streamlining in KPU decision-making processes in areas
such as curriculum approval, program review and development, and
policy development.
