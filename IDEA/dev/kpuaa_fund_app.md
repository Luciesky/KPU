DATES: Proposed dates of the event. 
  
    Spring 2014 Semester – Before the 2014 IDEA Amazon Field School in May


HISTORY: Is this an annual event or a one‐time event? Please provide all related historical information. 

The first IDEA Amazon Field School was held in the summer of 2013, and IDEA students and faculty are looking forward to returning in the summer semester of 2014 for the second time. The IDEA community is growing rapidly at KPU and we are hopeful that this would become an annual event in the spring of each year to support and promote KPU's unique Amazon Field School.


AUDIENCE: What is the audience profile of the event? How many people are expected to attend? 
  
Current and past IDEA students, KPU students from all other disciplines and programs, family members, KPU faculty and the community are welcome to share in the evening of stories, conversation and IDEA activities. The Alumni would also like to invite dignitaries from the South American and Colombian community residing in the lower mainland such as the Colombian Consular.


DESCRIPTION: Describe the event by including the event’s main elements, objectives and all relevant 
information. 

As the IDEA program at KPU continues to grow, the need has arisen by popular demand from the students of the first Amazon Field School to relive the experience and to support the new group of KPU students taking part this coming 
summer. This event will offer the alumni of the first field school to give support, share stories and experiences with current students as well as bring the IDEA community at KPU together. Through personal presentations, multi-media displays, and discussion of the current issues in the Amazon and Colombia, the new students will become familiar with the field school. It will also be an opportunity for parents and other faculty to become familiar with what IDEA can offer. The IDEA program is also holding the 3rd annual Evening of Illumination on December 9, 2013. IDEA students are proactively engaged in lifelong learning, and the creation of an alumni group to support these events is becoming a much-needed component.
  
  
TIMELINE: Please provide a timeline of the activities that need to take place with key dates and 
milestones. 

    The 2014 Amazon Field School has already been approved.  If the IDEA Alumni Group can secure funding for
    refreshments and other supplies required for the event, then advertising, Conference Centre booking and event 
    planning can continue in January 2014.  We would like to begin the advertising campaign as soon as possible in 
    the new year to ensure good event support.

COMMUNICATIONS: How do you intend to market your event and recognize KPUAA?    

1)	A banner ad on the KPU homepage
2)	Digital marketing on the KPU internal digital signage system 
3)	Posters distributed around KPU and the general community
4)	Announcements on the daily KPU email broadcast
5)	Web promotion on deepskill.ca and rosslaird.com
6)	Social media promotion on Twitter and Facebook (IDEA and KPU student group pages)
7)	Word of mouth through students of IDEA courses at KPU, inviting friends and family who may not be aware of what
    IDEA courses can offer.
8)	We will also approach CBC for an interview about the event. Ross Laird, the developer of IDEA, has appeared on
    CBC (both radio and television) many times to discuss creativity, education, and youth development. 
 

IMPACT & BENEFIT: Please articulate the benefits to the University and the Alumni community. How 
does your event align with the vision and commitments of the Kwantlen Polytechnic University Alumni Association (KPUAA)?  

    The IDEA Alumni Present the Amazon is an evening of IDEA.  IDEA focuses on specific modalities such as inquiry-based
    curriculum, reflective scholarship, intensive interaction, and interdisciplinarity. These approaches are not only of
    great benefit to students but are all listed in the KPU Academic Plan as being foundational priorities for KPU.
    Additionally, the Academic Plan highlights the importance of values such as global citizenship, inspiration,
    compassion, imagination, and personal growth. These values are core elements of the IDEA philosophy in general and 
    are articulated specifically in the IDEA core values list. The Academic Plan further emphasizes skills such as 
    effective communication, openness to diversity and inclusion, and creative and critical thinking. Again, these are
    all integral to the IDEA process, will be foundational to the event, and are specifically articulated as core goals 
    in our program philosophy documentation.

    We find similar correlations when we examine the KPU Strategic Plan, which describes the importance of distinctive
    programming, innovative teaching and learning, experiential learning, enriched student experience, and purposeful 
    community engagement. Each of these core goals for KPU matches a core value for IDEA and will be integral to the 
    the event.

    IDEA is sponsored by the KPU Faculty of Arts, which has just completed a new Academic Plan aligned with the KPU
    Academic and Strategic Plans. We therefore see similar correlations in values, approaches, and goals. For example, 
    the Arts Academic Plan specifically emphasizes goals such as the enhancement of experiential learning, the wider 
    adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, the
    importance of preparing learners for global citizenship, and the crucial role of mentorship. All of these broad goals
    are specifically articulated in IDEA philosophies and practices and will be embodied by the Evening of Illumination.
    
    There is a high degree of symmetry between the stated goals of KPU, on
    many levels, and the articulated goals of IDEA and the Evening of Illumination. We believe that IDEA, and this event,
    embody in a very fundamental way the kind of institution that KPU has said it wants to be.

    This event offer the opportunity for students, faculty, and the community to meet on a level field and to explore 
    ourselves and how we interact with each other at KPU, in our community and with the world. It is by coming together 
    as a group that we begin to understand and to be open to ourselves as people and the views and perceptions of others.
    This event fosters a transformative forum to come together as people to be aware of these core values and to embark
    upon new friendships and personal growth.

    And finally, as this event may be the first contact, for some KPU students, with the core values of KPU and the 
    IDEA program, there will also be residual benefits. KPU students (or community members) may look further into enrolling
    in IDEA courses at KPU as a result of their experiences at the event.


BUDGET: Please specify the amount of your request, provide your event budget, and indicate the 
amount of sponsorship this event requires as well as how the money will be spent. If this event includes 
a fee to participate please include the ticket price and the number of tickets expected to sell.  
 
    As the IDEA community at KPU is growing, we would like to raise the awareness of IDEA Events and their useful 
    place at KPU and in the community to foster the core ideas of both IDEA and KPU. A sponsor such as the KPUAA
    would give IDEA events greater profile and much-needed funding to further these initiatives.

The Evening of Illumination is free to attend, as all supplies for the activities are provided by event organizers.
The KPU Conference Centre space is provided by the university.
