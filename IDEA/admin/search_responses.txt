To all the applicants who we are *not* going to interview:

Hi <applicant>;

Recently you submitted an application to teach Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA) at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. Those of us on the search committee wanted to send along our thanks, and we also wanted to let you know about some developments in the search process. As you may know, IDEA is a small and nascent program with big ideas. As we move forward, we'll be bringing new people on board in a slow and incremental fashion. During the current phase of our development we have space for one new member, with perhaps another member starting next year. And yet, we (the search committee) were very surprised and heartened to receive many exemplary applications for our search. It seems that quite a few people are interested in doing what we are doing (reinventing post-secondary education, more or less).

As we reviewed the applications, we were acutely aware of the fact that we will only be able to offer one course, to one new member, for next semester. This is a significant problem for us, as we are keen to forge relationships with many of the applicants, like yourself, who showed so much enthusiasm and uniqueness. The pool of applicants represents a large cohort of professional educators who are working in creative and innovative ways. And most of these educators are working on their own, trying to transform a post-secondary educational system in urgent need of renewal. In our experience, many educational innovators seek like-minded peers for mutual collegiality and support. And, although IDEA is still a small initiative and limited in resources, one of our main goals is to provide a context and community for just this type of professional collegiality and support. So, although we are not able to offer you a position at the moment, we'd like to ask if you might be interested in staying in touch. We hope to grow the IDEA program, we plan to forge various alliances, and we are committed to creating a community of like-minded educators working on similar themes.

If you would like to continue the conversation about educational renewal with us, please contact Ross Laird (ross@rosslaird.com). Again, many thanks for your application. We were impressed and heartened to see the work you are doing and the clear commitment you have made to the kinds of principles and practices we believe in. 

On behalf of the IDEA Search Committee,

Ross Laird

To all the applicants we *are* going to interview:

Hi <applicant>;

Recently you submitted an application to teach Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA) at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. We were impressed and heartened by your application: you seem to have made a clear commitment to the kinds of principles and practices we believe in. We'd like to meet with you, over the coming weeks, to get to know you more and to have a wide-ranging discussion about education. As you know, IDEA is a small and nascent program with big ideas. Essentially, we are trying to reinvent post-secondary education, and perhaps you can help us accomplish this absurdly ambitious aim.

In preparation for our meeting, we'd like to ask that you prepare a short session that demonstrates your approach to teaching and learning. We don't want to impose a firm time frame, but something in the range of 15 to 30 minutes would probably work best. The search committee will be your students (or learners, if you prefer that term) in this session. We're not trying to create a simulation, so we don't have to pretend that the search committee represents university students in the classroom. Rather, we'd just like to experience a bit of what you do, however that looks. And it's especially important to us that you not feel limited to presenting material that might be suitable for an interview in a regular university context. IDEA is a fundamentally different kind of program, and we are looking for people who demonstrate innovative, creative approaches. IDEA classes routinely use movement, music, creative expression, meditation, multimedia arts, outdoor experiences, and many other approaches. So, feel free to show us whatever works best for you.

If you like, your session can offer a specific post-secondary learning goal; or it might be more fluid and organic, encouraging the participants to discover their own unique insights and knowledge. Either way is fine with us; we are not looking for specific content but rather a general sense of how you build a learning environment and interact within it. The main thing to remember is this: IDEA is not typical, and we don't want you to be either.

We've also attached several IDEA course outlines. We'd like you to review these outlines in advance of the interview to get a sense of how you might see yourself contributing to the existing curriculum. Which of the existing courses might you like to teach? You will also notice that the curriculum is very broad. One of our goals in IDEA is to add to and integrate the curriculum toward a degree or similar pathway. So, we'd also like you to think about what you would add. What is missing? What courses would you like to develop? One of the main goals of this search process is to find new and distinctive voices to help build what is, at the moment, a very small curriculum base. We want the new curriculum to be different from what exists now, and yet we also want new contributions to blend with and build upon our current offerings
.
If you have any questions about the interview or about the attached materials, please feel free to get in touch with Ross Laird (ross@rosslaird.com). Otherwise, we look forward to meeting you.
