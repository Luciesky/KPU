Problem statement 

Most of the students who come to Kwantlen are unprepared or under-prepared for university. And almost half of them subsequently leave without earning a credential from us. Of those who remain, more than a thousand each year find themselves on academic probation. We are losing or under-serving the great majority of our students.

We are making efforts to remedy this situation: various academic supports exist, programs are starting to think more about enrollment and retention, and we have begun to reach out to our community partners in secondary education. But we could (and should) do more, much more. We need a strategic approach that is based on best practices, current research, and measurable outcomes. We need to get students to Kwantlen, keep them here, and increase the likelihood of their success. We cannot accomplish this aim simply by providing a few workshops in academic preparation (which has been our basic approach so far). We need a more consolidated approach that is specifically designed to increase loyalty, retention, and performance for our students and their unique needs.

Here is a map of how to get there. 


Recommended solution 

We propose a complete reinvention of the Boost Camps program. Instead of offering periodic workshops, we will focus instead on a program of mentorship and engagement. Students in the program will join a community based on mentorship and will be guided through a series of activities that have been shown to be effective in fostering student success. The program will be facilitated through a collaboration between faculty in Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA), staff in the Learning Centre, and students who have demonstrated leadership at Kwantlen. The program will be embedded within a research and outcomes framework that will help us identify what works best for our students and what kinds of iterative, incremental improvements we need to make over time. 

Here's how the program would look:

1. Every student in the program (the program might include students on academic probation or every new Kwantlen student) is assigned a peer mentor who meets individually with the student (or in a small group) before the beginning of the semester or within a week of being placed on academic probation. The peer mentors are trained by faculty in Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts and meet with the students for a minimum of one hour per week (alternating between individual and group meetings). The peer mentors are drawn from participants in the IDEA leadership class (IDEA 3302) or volunteer directly, and are ideally third and fourth year students who are familiar with Kwantlen and know what it takes to thrive here. If enrolled in IDEA 3100, 3302, or 4100, peer mentors have the option of earning credit for their participation in the program. 

2. Every student in the program works with his or her peer mentor to develop a comprehensive plan for addressing the specific needs of the student. The plan will address the physical, emotional, social, and academic needs of each student. Research has shown that the academic hurdles faced by students do not primarily involve academic matters but are more generally issues of personal development. These issues include lack of motivation and direction, personal and familial stress, mental health issues of all kinds (anxiety and depression being the most prevalent) and substance abuse. Working with the mentor leaders (IDEA faculty), the mentors provide direct support to students in the program. 

3. Once a week, the entire cohort meets either in the Conference Centre or off campus. These sessions are comprised of a customized version of IDEA 1100, a course designed specifically to help students navigate the personal development challenges they face (and the only such course at Kwantlen). The cohort meetings are led by IDEA faculty and involve activities that promote community engagement, interdisciplinary academic inquiry, and personal growth. These three themes are consistently correlated with student performance in post-secondary environments.

4. Once a month, the peer mentors and the program participants meet with staff in the Learning Centre to work on academic plans and goals. These meetings, which are part of IDEA 1100, help students to integrate their interpersonal development with academic opportunities and pathways at Kwantlen.

5. Each student in the program participates in a qualitative and quantitative research initiative to measure and track concrete, measurable outcomes. We need to know the extent to which the program increases student success, loyalty, retention, performance, and development; and we need to know how to incrementally improve. By designing research into the program from the beginning, we utilize best practices for our methodology and delivery. Our research strategy might involve the following:

Pre and post measures (e.g. student performance and development profile before and after IDEA 1100) 
GPA Comparisons (assessment of GPA change after IDEA 1100)
Qualitative Reports (e.g. querying students in the program about their experience at Kwantlen, intentions to stay at Kwantlen, reasons for wanting to drop out, etc. to provide richer data about experience not accessible with mass surveys)

6. Students remain in the program for one semester (or, optionally, two semesters, as significantly greater gains will likely be consolidated over eight months and will lead to greater retention success). At the end of the semester they will have received more than 60 hours of direct mentorship and will complete the program with a clear and comprehensive academic plan.

7. Once a month for the next two semesters, the cohort gathers for a followup meeting to consolidate and reinforce gains made in the program. Ongoing issues and challenges are identified and addressed. Peer mentors continue providing support as needed. 

The above framework is designed to be flexible and modular. It could be implemented with a small pilot group or applied broadly across the community of Kwantlen's new or struggling students. (Costs would vary depending on the approach.)


Benefits

This type of approach works. (If you'd like to see the truckload of research, let us know.) Students who enroll in this program -- especially students who are struggling -- will experience a much greater degree of engagement and support than they would otherwise receive from a more piecemeal approach. More will stay, more will thrive, more will succeed. Students who successfully complete the program will demonstrate a higher level of achievement in their future studies, and the overall quality of Kwantlen's programs will increase. Faculty will face fewer challenges from unprepared students. Students will be more confident and mature. Kwantlen will demonstrate leadership and innovation in dealing with the most pressing problem in the post-secondary landscape (unprepared students).


Project Fees

For the smallest possible implementation of this program the direct cost would be $25,000 annually, which is less than the cost, to Kwantlen, of two students dropping out after the first year. Accordingly, even in its tiniest iteration the program would pay for itself many times over, as we are confident of success with far greater numbers than two. 

The direct fee for the smallest possible implementation - what might be conceptualized as a pilot project - consists of the assignment of an IDEA faculty member to one section of IDEA 1100 in the fall and spring semesters. More ambitious (and more effective) implementations would involve scaling up by adding sections of IDEA 1100. At the moment, IDEA could support at least 10 sections annually.

Indirect fees will include the participation of Learning Centre staff, the utilization of Kwantlen's counselling and Academic Advising services, and incidental fees for activities (field trip fees, for example). We do not expect incidental fees to exceed $1000 annually. 


Let's get this done. 

At Kwantlen we've been talking for some time about the seemingly difficult problem of student preparedness and performance. But the problem is not intractable; it simply requires of us a strategic and active approach delivered by people focused on the scholarship of engagement and mentorship. In IDEA, this is what we do. This is the service we provide.

We're ready to go.
