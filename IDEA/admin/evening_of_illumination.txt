Please join us for an evening of creativity, play, movement, music and meditation on Tuesday, January 29 in the Conference Centre of Kwantlen's Surrey campus (7-9:30pm). This celebration will focus on the tasks of finding illumination in the heart of winter. How do we discover creativity, mindfulness, embodiment, and purposeful activity in the season of shadows? What tasks are required of each of us, so that we find illumination and renewal in ourselves and our communities? How can we explore this together, in the spirit of play, fun, and devotion?

In the darkness of winter we find ways to look within, to reflect on our experiences, and to explore our hopes for the coming days of greater light. At this event we have the opportunity to rediscover and co-create this ancient ritual. Drawing on various traditions -- mindfulness meditation, creative expression, rhythm, music, and other modalities -- we will cultivate a space for reflection, for inner transformation, for connecting with the body and the breath, for nurturing hope, for building community. We will create our own illuminations.
