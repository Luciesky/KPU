"Prior to faculty developing a detailed program concept for
presentation to DPAC, the dean(s) responsible for the area must
present a summary document of two pages or less to the Program
Resource Committee (PRC). The document must offer a high level
synopsis of the proposed program and its relation to program
priorities as outlined in the VP Academic Plan and the Kwantlen
Strategic Plan; a preliminary budget assessment of direct and indirect
program costs; and rationale demonstrating the ongoing viability of
the program." This is the information Linda will require in order to
prepare the summary document in conjunction with Rob Adamoski.
