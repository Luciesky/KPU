Executive Summary
=================

C.1	Explain how this concept adheres to principles and priorities as indicated in ministerial, institutional, and academic planning documents. Is this concept supportable and sustainable with existing and/or available resources?

Contemporary Studies is an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree program built upon a core interdisciplinary curriculum. The core curriculum provides a foundation and scaffold upon which learners construct a program of study to explore contemporary themes in arts and culture. The core curriculum integrates coursework from diverse fields to ensure that the program of study is not simply a collection of credits but rather a tightly conjoined thematic path of scholarship.

The Contemporary Studies Program Matches Kwantlen's Vision
----------------------------------------------------------

In keeping with Kwantlen's new vision document (from which all quotations in this section are taken), Contemporary Studies would be an authentically "innovative, transformative, and ambitious..." degree program. The Contemporary Studies program would "inspire students to excel in their careers, lead in their communities, and succeed in their lives." By design and application, the Contemporary Studies program is well-positioned to "deliver university degrees... which reflect and express our polytechnic mandate" -- and to deliver many possible degrees at no added cost to Kwantlen.

The Contemporary Studies program would emphasize "the relationship between teacher and student. The program would "provide students with an ethical framework, critical understanding, and social awareness necessary for good citizenship." Contemporary Studies emphasizes "applied education within the context of broad-based undergraduate learning to prepare our students for successful and rewarding careers." 

A polytechnic institution means an interdisciplinary institution, with relationships fostered across and between disciplines. Contemporary Studies would offer and facilitate such collaboration, and would offer an outstanding method of promoting Kwantlen's unique character and the distinctive offerings of the Faculty of Humanities.

Contemporary Studies would embody Kwantlen's commitments to "program bridging, acknowledgement of relevant experience, and flexible learning pathways." Many faculty members across many departments at Kwantlen have expressed strong interest in program bridging, flexible learning pathways and interdisciplinary collaboration. Contemporary Studies offers an outstanding method for fulfilling these requests.

Contemporary Studies offers "a broad-based education, and acknowledges the importance of balancing depth and breadth of study."(Please see testimonials.)

Contemporary Studies could be a "flagship program" to showcase Kwantlen's innovation and creativity as an institution. Contemporary Studies would be an "exceptional program" that "reflects the institution's applied mandate and furthers its reputation."

The Contemporary Studies program would provide "transformative experiences that integrate academic learning with principles of civic responsibility and community engagement." Contemporary Studies courses would involve the discovery (or rediscovery) of the authentic joy of purposeful, relevant, applied learning. _Transformative_ is a tough word to live up to, but Contemporary Studies would do so (existing CUST and IDEA already do).

The Contemporary Studies program would promote "applied research and scholarly activities that enhance our teaching and enrich our communities" through active collaborations with research institutes (such as CIR:CLE), community-based partnerships (with various groups), and service learning.

The Contemporary Studies Program Matches Kwantlen's Academic Priorities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In keeping with Kwantlen's Academic Priorities document (from which all quotations in this section are taken), the Contemporary Studies BA would be a "new program" that reflects "community needs, labour market and broad societal education needs, and which are in keeping with Kwantlen’s values and mandate as a Polytechnic University."

Contemporary Studies would be an "undergraduate program that support Kwantlen’s values in academic areas where there is need." As Contemporary Studies can (potentially) contribute to all areas, the opportunities for program enhancement at Kwantlen are vast.

The Contemporary Studies program would offer "learning opportunities to inform program design." Indeed, the Contemporary Studies foundation program would be at the forefront of learning design at Kwantlen (see section F, Program Description). Innovations in learning technologies, experimental and experiential learning, student-led initiatives, community collaborations, and many other related approaches will all be foundational to the Contemporary Studies program.

The Contemporary Studies program would provide "opportunities that encourage faculty to develop new teaching interests and methodologies in keeping with the institution’s mandate." Contemporary Studies would be a kind of interdisciplinary hub for innovations in teaching at Kwantlen, with many faculty members seeking consultation and collaboration to adopt methods used in Contemporary Studies.

The Contemporary Studies program would offer "additional programming" that would enhance "advising and mentoring for students," and would be its own "student success and retention system." The exemplary teaching approaches, interdisciplinary methods, and student-led initiatives of the   Contemporary Studies program would ensure theat students would be deeply affected by their experiences in Contemporary Studies courses.

The Contemporary Studies program would "promote scholarship of teaching and learning throughout the university that fosters collaboration between faculty and students." Contemporary Studies would facilitate "excellence in teaching, research and service." The exceptional level of excellence demonstrated by Contemporary Studies can already be seen in the testimonials of CUST and IDEA students. Contemporary Studies would be an outstanding example of what the Kwantlen experience can be.

The Contemporary Studies program would foster "a culture of transparency, openness, dialogue, and mutual understanding regarding the purpose of the University through retreats, workshops, and other venues for the exchange of ideas." Moreover, the Contemporary Studies program would support "initiatives to increase scholarly and research activity within and across a range of Faculties."

The Contemporary Studies program would "encourage and support development of new teaching interests and methodologies. Indeed, Contemporary Studies would be a hub for innovation in teaching at Kwantlen. The program would supports (and lead) "the use of enhanced and advanced technology in the delivery of program material."

The Contemporary Studies Program Matches Kwantlen's Budget Strategic Priorities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In keeping with Kwantlen's Budget Strategic Priorities document (from which all quotations in this section are taken), the Contemporary Studies program is uniquely poised to "implement new programs, especially undergraduate degree programs" at little or no cost. Existing curriculum from various departments could be integrated into many kinds of interdisciplinary degrees.

The Contemporary Studies program would provide "opportunities that encourage faculty to develop new teaching interests and methodologies in keeping with the institution’s new mandate."

Because of the program's design, "advising and mentoring" would be built into the curriculum and process for the Contemporary Studies program. The Contemporary Studies program would help with enrolment, "both number of students and number of courses per student."

The Contemporary Studies program would "facilitate effective collegial relationships" by way of their interdisciplinary nature and function. The program would facilitate the "growth of innovation and application... within and across a range of Faculties" (and would be almost unique at Kwantlen in this respect).

Degree Pathways and Interdisciplinary Approaches
------------------------------------------------

The interdisciplinary nature of the Contemporary Studies program would facilitate straightforward development of new degrees and programs, which can be implemented with little or no cost. Foundational courses in interdisciplinary approaches could be used across various degrees. With little effort, and by leveraging Contemporary Studies projects and collaborations, Kwantlen could become a leader in teaching innovation in Canada.

One example of a highly successful implementation of an interdisciplinary curricular core that leads to multiple degrees is that of The University of King's College, Canada's oldest university. The [student-centered](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC7rKnBx7pg) and collaborative character of the King's programs is one reason that King's has the highest student satisfaction ratings of any university on the country.

It's clear that interdisciplinary collaborations and streamed degree offerings are an excellent way forward for small and new universities competing against larger and more traditional peers. Mark Taylor, chair of the department of religion at Columbia University, states the situation succinctly in a recent essay in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110419/full/472261a.html):

"Universities must tear down the walls that separate fields, and establish programmes that nourish cross-disciplinary investigation and communication. They must design curricula that focus on solving practical problems, such as providing clean water to a growing population... "

A recent [editorial](http://chronicle.com/article/Degrees-for-What-Jobs-Wrong/127328/) by Carol Geary Schneider (president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities) in _The Chronicle of Higher Education_ reinforces the view that universities can respond to contemporary challenges by placing "more emphasis on cross-disciplinary intellectual skills and on providing students with the broad knowledge base necessary to understand the complex contexts in which they will work."

The Contemporary Studies program would facilitate students developing [independent academic agendas](http://vimeo.com/17338538) in the spirit of best practices for modern liberal arts education (at places like [NYU](https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/NYU+Sakai+3+Vision+Statement), for example). The program would meet the challenges we face with a spirit of optimism, enthusiasm, and a welcoming acknowledgement that the way forward is to embrace what Kwantlen has said it wants to be: a _different, unique, transformative_ institution.

Access
======

D.1. 	What entry requirements should applicants be expected to meet? If there are multiple entry points, please specify requirements for each. Are entrance requirements appropriate? Are students likely to be successful?

Kwantlen’s commitment to accessibility is founded upon a long history of serving the needs of the South Fraser region of British Columbia. The Contemporary Studies program (the Major as well as associated activities for first and second year learners) will be keenly sensitive to these needs and will provide educational opportunities to a wide range of learners. Indeed, given its structure and purpose, the Contemporary Studies program will be one of the most diverse programs offerings at Kwantlen.

The program will provide opportunities for students with diverse backgrounds to choose educational pathways that best suit their needs. Interdisciplinary learning, career-focused curriculum, culturally-sensitive content, and practicum opportunities will foster accessible, lifelong learning for those in the Contemporary Studies program. Flexible, multidimensional teaching (based on mentorship and the fusion of personal and professional development) will ensure that the program is tailored to the specific needs of learners. Multiple modes of learning across multiple campuses will enhance the program’s accessibility and desirability for many learners. The Contemporary Studies program will be both comprehensive and responsive to the needs of community and industry.

Learners will be guided through the pathways of entry to the Major from the moment of their first expression of interest in Contemporary, Cultural, or Interdisciplinary. The Contemporary Studies program will draw many learners who are interested in a diverse and challenging university experience. Many of these types of learners currently struggle with finding pathways through and beyond first year. They encounter hurdles of language, qualification, process, and administration. The Contemporary Studies program will seek out these learners from the point of their initial entry at Kwantlen and provide for them access to educational mentorship to facilitate their smooth entry and continuity at Kwantlen. 

The regular Kwantlen BA entrance requirements will apply to those learners entering Kwantlen from secondary school or as mature learners. Learners may be admitted into the Contemporary Studies  program at any time that admission requirements are met and will receive priority course registration.

For admission to the program, learners must have a grade of ‘B’ in English 12 (or equivalents) and a grade of ‘C’ in either Principles of Math 11 (or equivalent) or Applications of Math 12. Learners who do not qualify upon initial application at Kwantlen but possess at least a ‘C’ in English 12 (or equivalent) and a passing grade in Principles of Math 11 (or equivalent) or Applications of Math 12 will be able to apply for entry to the BA Qualifying Year.

Learners will be admitted to the program in the first year provided they have successfully completed appropriate admission procedures. Unsuccessful applicants will be encouraged to meet an Educational Advisor for the appropriate qualifying courses that satisfy the application criteria. Registration access to third or fourth year courses will be first awarded to learners who have completed at least 60 credits or coursework with a cumulative GPA of 2.00, as well as a grade of ‘C’ in all required courses including the English writing requirement, 2 Quantitative courses, 12 credits of breadth courses, the language requirement, Principles of Math 11 (or equivalent), and all first and second year course requirements for their declared major and/or minor program(s). 

Some learners will also transfer from other institutions under the normal Kwantlen transfer guidelines. Others will choose the Contemporary Studies program after completing a Trades or English Language Proficiency diploma at Kwantlen (using pathways already established by, for example, The School of Business).

The Contemporary Studies program will make active links to learners in secondary school, to those with unconventional learning backgrounds, to those who bring diverse cultural identities, and to those who have not found an educational home within the traditional university system. Finding and mentoring these learners in their first year (and even before their first year) will be a primary goal of the Contemporary Studies program.

From application to graduation, a seamless system of support involving all members of the Kwantlen community will ensure that the learning environment of the Contemporary Studies program will maximize student success. First and second year programs, academic advising, learning centers, supplemental instruction, financial aid opportunities, and required foundational course will work to ensure that learners attain their chosen credentials.

Details and Requirements 
------------------------------

Learners will achieve the BA Contemporary Studies degree by completing a minimum of 120 credit hours with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0. At least 45 credits must be taken at the upper levels (3000 or higher).

The following requirements (essential to completing all Kwantlen general arts degree programs)  are to be completed during the first 60 credits of study:

A six-credit writing-intensive requirement.

A minimum 9-credit quantitative requirement, at least 6 credits of which are to be completed within the first 60 credits taken. These 9 credits must include a minimum of 3 courses.

At least three credits (i.e., one course) of the above 9 quantitative credits must be taken from courses offered by the Faculty of Science, Mathematics and Technology or School of Horticulture.

A 24-credit breadth requirement, consisting of a minimum of one 1000-2000 level course in at least four separate social science or humanities disciplines outside of Creative Writing and Visual Arts. Courses identified as liberal education and capstone courses also may be credited toward this requirement.

A second language to grade 11 or 6-credit post-secondary language requirement is required. (Learners who can demonstrate competency in a second language may have this requirement waived).

24 Contemporary Studies credits (CUST, IDEA, CONT) are required within the first 60 credits. These foundational courses will assist learners in shaping their educational paths.

In addition, learners must complete the following to earn the degree: a minimum of 120 credits, with at least 45 credits at the 3000 or 4000 levels; CUST, IDEA, or CONT 3100 and IDEA 4100, the capstone courses; at least 60 credits at Kwantlen Polytechnic University  (this last requirement may be reduced with approval from the BA Degree Advisor).

In the context of the degree, the capstone courses will provide a specific, pedagogically-driven structure of community placement and mentor review. Learners will demonstrate their learning by way of assessment by a panel of peers, community mentors, and faculty advisors.

The Contemporary Studies program will include 12 required credits in the first two years: a foundation year program involving introduction to interdisciplinarity and to great works within the Arts and Sciences, and a  second-year transition program focusing on preparation for the Major.

D2. Will the structure of the program allow for full-time, part-time, evening, weekend, on-line, mixed-mode delivery methods, or a combination of any of these?

The program will employ blended learning methods for all courses. Learners may enroll full-time or part-time. Some courses will be offered fully online.

D.3 	Will the structure of the program allow for multiple entry and exit points?

Learners may be admitted to the Contemporary Studies Major after having earned a maximum of 60 credits toward the degree. Placement in the program will be based on articulated credits and prior-learning assessment. Learners may take courses on a part-time basis, and blended learning methods will be used for all courses.

Additionally, the Contemporary Studies program will be based on institutional links to various disciplines and programs at Kwantlen, so that multiple entry points will exist for learners who pursue certificates and diplomas in other areas. The structure of the program will support pathways for diploma and certificate learners to continue their learning to the degree level.


Student Profile
==========

E.1	Who are your target students (age, gender, educational background, work experience)? Where do they come from (recent high school graduates, mature students, transfers from other institutions)? How do you plan to recruit or attract these students? Are there other characteristics applicants should have that you identify as important?

Prospective learners will be comprised of recent high-school graduates, individuals transferring from other post-secondary institutions, mature learners returning to school for a career change, social services practitioners seeking augmentative learning, learners focusing on arts and cultural advocacy, learners focusing on the business of arts in the public sphere, learners continuing on to degrees after completing certificates or diplomas at Kwantlen, and members of the general public with an interest in interdisciplinarity, culture, media, and contemporary issues. Prospective learners will possess a wide variety of vocational, educational, and life experiences but will share a commitment to creativity, innovation, and personal development. The program will attract a diverse range of learners pursuing many fields: social and cultural services; mental health services; community health and development; arts advocacy and development; cultural advocacy and development; primary and secondary education; counselling; personal and professional development; professional arts (writing, visual arts, music, etc.); religious studies; recreational therapies; arts research; arts performance; arts and craft professionals.

E.2.	 How will the program address the needs of under-prepared students? How will you get these students into a qualifying year? 

To meet the needs of under-prepared learners, opportunities for prior-learning assessment will be provided. Kwantlen offers a comprehensive, laddered system of appropriate preparatory courses. Additionally, learners will be required to complete CONT 1100, a course that prepares learners for the Contemporary Studies program.

The program will attract many learners who have multicultural and diverse backgrounds. Accordingly, some learners will need assistance with various aspects of cultural and academic transition. As the program emphasizes cultural themes, these learners will be mentored through qualifying pathways and assisted with academic development beginning in their first semester (through a mentorship initiative embedded in Contemporary Studies 1100).

E.3	How will the program address equity by decreasing systemic barriers? Is this type of program traditionally or historically underrepresented in specific cohort groups? (e.g., gender and/or age  imbalance, First Nations) How will the program address these issues?

The Contemporary Studies program will encourage – by its very nature – linkages to various under-represented cultural groups in the South Fraser region. The flexible curriculum and culturally appropriate pedagogy will be of great interest to those learners who seek alternate modes of inquiry and engagement.

The Contemporary Studies Major will be a desirable educational destination among those who are just beginning their post-secondary journey and are in search of a learning environment that is accessible, relevant, integrative, and interdisciplinary. These young learners are the foundation of Kwantlen’s role in the community and represent an essential cohort group that is traditionally under-represented in the post-secondary system in British Columbia. The Contemporary Studies program will respond to this challenge by welcoming traditional learners as well as those who might be termed ‘non-conventional.’ Such learners will recognize, in the Contemporary Studies program, an educational environment that has created a space and place for their distinctive needs and schedules.

Program Description
=============

F.1	Provide a broad description of the program outcomes, and how this program relates to existing or proposed programs at Kwantlen:

Contemporary Studies are based on innovative pedagogy and integrative approaches to learning. Contemporary Studies involve the synthesis and synergy of various disciplines toward a cohesive, unified educational experience. Interdisciplinarity is much more than enrollment in courses from more than a single discipline. Authentic interdisciplinarity emphasizes the linkages between disciplines by focusing on contrasting and complementary aspects of diverse educational domains. Interdisciplinary studies encourage students to develop broader intellectual skills, greater facility for critical thinking, and greater awareness of the social relevance of their education. Interdisciplinary students have the opportunity to develop exemplary skills in problem solving, insight, team-building, lateral thinking, and multi-modal learning styles. Interdisciplinary strategies involve approaching an issue or problem from various perspectives. This typically entails intellectual inquiries that range beyond the borders of any single discipline or domain. While still respecting the function of the boundaries between domains, interdisciplinary approaches recognize that those boundaries are essentially arbitrary and do not always serve the goals of learning. Global warming and the AIDS pandemic are two examples of contemporary issues that require interdisciplinary approaches. 

Contemporary Studies emphasize the interdisciplinary integration of many educational domains. Current educational opportunities in BC for undergraduate interdisciplinary training are sparse. BC universities have not taken advantage of the recent worldwide groundswell of interest in undergraduate interdisciplinary approaches. Kwantlen’s Contemporary Studies program will offer foundational courses in diverse disciplines. Additionally, the Contemporary Studies program will offer integrative and interdisciplinary courses in the professional application of these disciplines. Learners will deepen their innovation and creativity and will learn skills to allow them to adapt to rapidly changing labour markets. 

In responding to demographic trends toward integrative approaches to the arts, culture, health, business, and community development, the program will offer learners a solid career path as well as a number of choices for continued study.

F.2	How does the proposed program support existing programs at Kwantlen?

The Contemporary Studies program will provide a destination for learners wishing to transfer into a Major program and any BA General Studies students who may wish to establish a more specific Major. Furthermore, the Contemporary Studies Major will attract students from two-year university-transfer programs at other regional universities and colleges. Moreover, the program will provide a place for students who have left larger institutions seeking excellent teaching, smaller classrooms, and a nurturing and supportive learning community.

Additionally –  and importantly – the Contemporary Studies program will forge links between many departments and programs at Kwantlen and will provide educational pathways for learners in diploma and certificate programs who wish to pursue education at the degree level. In this sense, the Contemporary Studies program will be an accessible bridge between diploma and certificate programs and undergraduate degrees.

And, finally, the Contemporary Studies Major will embody the fundamental charter of Kwantlen Polytechnic University, which is to provide interdisciplinary education. The word Polytechnic means, essentially, Interdisciplinary.

F.3.	Identify how the proposed program supports Kwantlen’s mission, core values, and strategic objectives?

Please see the Executive Summary.

F.4	How will the program ensure educational effectiveness (e.g., retention rates, completion rates, success rates for progression)?
Does the program create opportunities for students to ladder from current programs?

The Contemporary Studies program will recognize the essential integration of personal, academic, and professional development. Approaches to teaching will be based on foundational principles of mentorship, discovery, and learner autonomy. Interdisciplinary Arts faculty will demonstrate an authentic spirit of inquiry and model this for learners. In turn, learners will be supported in diverse modes of inquiry by a teaching environment that is collaborative, innovative, creative and respectful. The program will provide a dynamic community of inquiry that is learner-focused, innovative, interdisciplinary, and socially and culturally responsible. Teaching modes will emphasize mentorship, engagement, personal development, and interpersonal connection.

Learner engagement will extend beyond the classroom to encompass community and industry partners and peers. Interdisciplinary Arts faculty will recognize and be responsive to alternate approaches to teaching and complementary styles of learning. New technologies, emerging and experimental teaching methods, and research-driven pedagogy will be  embraced and contextualized within a learning environment founded upon personal relationships.

These values, approaches and perspectives will ensure educational effectiveness and loyalty among learners.

With regard to program content, the Contemporary Studies Major will allow learners to design programs of study that will prepare them for careers or further study in areas such as social services, cultural and arts industries, community service, primary and secondary education, professional arts and craft, religious studies, business, and graduate school. In addition to providing opportunities for the many internal students who wish to continue their education at Kwantlen beyond the first two years of study, the Contemporary Studies Major will provide opportunities for learners completing two years of undergraduate work at any of the colleges or universities in the province to transfer into the program when space is available.


F.5	Describe how the proposed program incorporates co-op placements, work experience, practicum, clinical practice, etc.: (if applicable)

From the beginning of their involvement with the Contemporary Studies program, learners will start to build bridges to community employers. Course projects will emphasize practical and career-driven application and will offer learners opportunities to collaborate with other departments at Kwantlen and with other learners. In this way learners will build a network of peers and contacts which will serve them well as they enter the workforce. Additionally, practicum and co-op experiences will be a foundational aspect of the learning activities of every Contemporary Studies participant.

F.6	Does this program include Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) as per Policy B.14 Credit for Prior Learning?

The Contemporary Studies program will include Prior Learning Assessment methods. A challenge assignment and interview will be required for each course for which a PLA is requested.

F.7 	Explain how current faculty are able to deliver the program, and if they are not, how this issue will be addressed.

The Contemporary Studies program will draw from multiple departments, each of which already possesses faculty qualified to teach the courses that will anchor first and second year and will act as capstones for the Major.


Outcomes
=======

G.1	Will this program allow students to continue with further study? 
Describe laddering, bridging, or post-credential continuation of education.

The Contemporary Studies program will prepare learners for careers or further study in diverse areas such as media, arts, culture, education, community development, collaborative and public arts, writing and publishing, arts performance, mental health, community health, primary and secondary education, professional arts advocacy, religious studies, etc. Many students will choose to continue on to graduate school in fields such as Psychology, Visual Arts, Creative Writing, Music, Expressive Arts Therapies, and Interdisciplinary Studies. The Contemporary Studies program will also prepare students exceptionally well for the Professional Development Program in Education.

G.2	What is the nature of the work students are being prepared for? Include current labour market data that shows a demand for this type of graduate.

As indicated above, the careers and further study available to graduates of the Contemporary Studies Major are very broad, and include multiple paths and options. It is, therefore, difficult to offer one clear perspective on the nature of work that learners will pursue. However, this proposal includes information for one type of graduate – the arts professional – but please note that this data applies only to that specific career path, not to the many other paths that learners in the program might choose.

Labour Market Data for the Arts Professional 
-----------------------------------------------------

25,900 artists in British Columbia spend more time at their art or cultural practice than at any other occupation. Among the 10 provinces, British Columbia has the largest percentage of its labour force in arts and culture occupations (1.08%), the only province above 1% and a figure that is well above the Canadian average of 0.77%. At $545 million, the total earnings of artists account for 0.65% of total earnings in the overall provincial labour force.

As compared with other provincial jurisdictions in Canada, the number of artists in British Columbia increased much more rapidly than the overall provincial labour force between 1991 and 2006 (58% vs. 37%). Between 1991 and 2001, the number of artists more than doubled in three large B.C. cities: Coquitlam, Richmond and Port Coquitlam. There was very significant growth in the arts in many other large B.C. cities, including Surrey (70%), Langley (82%), New Westminster (82%), and Kamloops (70%).

Please take a moment to re-read and absorb the increase in arts and culture professionals in Surrey and Langley, two of Kwantlen’s main catchment areas: 70% and 82%, respectively. This amounts to a veritable explosion of arts and culture professionals in the region. But it makes sense: in British Columbia, one in every 27 people has an arts or cultural occupation. Moreover, the average annual income of arts and culture professionals in British Columbia is 45% higher than the national average (but still relatively low, at $35,000).

The percentage of arts and culture professionals in British Columbia with a bachelor’s degree or higher is 37%, nearly double the rate in the general workforce. At 47%, the percentage of artists who are self-employed is over five times the self-employment rate in the overall labour force (9%). It’s clear from this last statistic that arts and culture professionals need training with regard to professional practice, which they will get in the Interdisciplinary Arts program.

Although artists work in many different sectors of the economy, the industry with the highest number of artists is arts, entertainment and recreation (10,000, or 39% of all artists). In addition, a substantial number of artists work in educational services (5,500) and information and cultural industries(5,000).

Arts and culture professionals in British Columbia work in many diverse fields but are represented most strongly in music (5,900), writing (4,300), visual arts (3,800), and artisans and craftspeople (3,500). Please note that these are precisely the core areas of the Contemporary Studies program.

The number of arts and culture professionals in Canada is greater than the number of Canadians directly employed in the automotive industry (135,000). As mentioned previously (though worth repeating), from 1991 to 2006 the number of arts and culture professionals in British Columbia grew by 58%  – the greatest increase in all of Canada, and much higher than the growth rate of the general labour force.

These statistics are widespread, well-established, and surprising for those not familiar with arts and culture professions. But the simple fact is that arts and culture industries  now employ more people in Canada – especially in British Columbia – than many other traditional industries (more than twice the number of forestry workers and banking industry professionals). The cultural sector in Canada now employs about 609,000 workers and comprises 3.3% of the overall labour force in Canada.

The Contemporary Studies program will be attentive to the fact that university-educated arts and culture professionals earn 38% more than artists with a high school education. (There were 90% more artists with a university certificate, diploma or degree in 2006 than in 1991.) University education has now become essential for arts and culture workers who wish to earn a reasonable income. When this consideration is coupled with the high rates of self-employment (42%, six times the rate in the overall labour force), the importance of career-focused, relevant curriculum becomes even more obvious. Currently, Kwantlen’s offering in this regard is limited. The Contemporary Studies program will change this situation by helping learners to implement lifelong strategies for economically successful careers in arts and culture. A graduate of the Contemporary Studies Major will know to make a living as an arts and culture professional.

Additionally, the number of arts and culture professionals in Canada from visible minority groups more than doubled in number between 1991 and 2006 (123% growth). As an institution with a primary cultural profile of visible minority groups, Kwantlen would do well to respond to this massive increase. The Contemporary Studies program, with its culturally relevant curriculum, is ideally situated to do so.
