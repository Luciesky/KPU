# IDEA

## Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts

We work across and between the disciplines, with a focus on integration.

We emphasize learner expressiveness and creativity.

We include all arts and sciences as pathways of scholarship.

---

# What we think about:

Learning (and teaching) for the whole person.

Integration of personal, professional, and academic development.

Learner engagement, initiative, collaboration, and mentorship.

Encouraging learners to take more responsibility for their learning.

# Who else is doing this?

[Quest University](http://questu.ca)

Approach: group work, project focus.

Mantra: “We started from scratch to build a university centered on you.”

[Stanford’s d.School](http://dschool.stanford.edu/)

Approach: maker spaces, hacker spaces, (almost) no formal class time.

Mantra: “A methodology for innovation that combines creative and analytical approaches, and requires collaboration across disciplines.”

[The ArtScience Lab at Harvard](http://thelaboratory.harvard.edu/concept/artscience/)

Approach: group work on creative projects for the market.

Mantra: “Labs are places of experience. We enter to explore.”

# The IDEA Mantra

## Your life. Your Learning. Your Way.

---

# How does it work?

The classroom as facilitation space.

Class time as interaction time.

The instructor as colleague and mentor.

Student-built content within and beyond the classroom.

---

# What does it look like?

We sit in a circle for the large group, and in small groups for everything
else.

We don’t use tables unless required for a specific purpose.

We create improvised maker spaces and hacker spaces.

Most class time (90% or more) is spent experientially and facilitated by learners working individually or in groups.

The instructor facilitates the process of learners facilitating one another.

Instructor contributions to the large group are limited to short blocks of a few minutes (5-10).

The instructor only delivers content that cannot be accessed in
other ways (from readings, group experiences, or individual effort).

The instructor’s content role is focused on contextualization, mentorship, and unique wisdom.

---

# What about assignments?

Learners create self-directed projects (3 per course, typically) with included
self-assessments and self-grading (using exhaustive criteria).

Instructors evaluate the projects and consult with students about self-
assessments.

No exams, no small assignments, no multiple-choice tests (and no PowerPoint).

Group work in the classroom (and outside the classroom) represents from 25 to 50 percent of a learner’s grade. Individual projects account for the rest.

---

# How well does it work?

Learners report feeling engaged and responsible for their work.

They report that their overall academic performance (in all courses) increases.

IDEA represents less than half of one percent of courses in the Faculty of
Arts. Yet in 2012, almost 20 percent of the learners on the Dean’s Honour Roll
(including the winner of the Dean’s Medal) were learners who had taken at least one IDEA course.

So, it works pretty well.

---

# What about workload?

This approach is more work (not less): learning group facilitation and
mentorship skills, interacting with learners and their projects, rebuilding
most of the structure each semester.

But the work is more interesting and fun than what we might otherwise do
(lecture, grade, repeat).

On balance, it feels like less work, and less like work.
