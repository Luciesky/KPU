<h3>The Nature of Interdisciplinarity </h3>


<h3>Themes and Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>What's broken, why it's broken, and why we should not try (too hard) to fix it.
<li>What creative freedom means today: new models for releasing your work in the wild.
<li>Understanding and dealing with text as a commodity.
<li>The meanings of Open, Free, Closed, and Proprietary (and the risks and opportunities offered by each).
<li>Free (as in beer), free (as in speech): what's that all about?
<li>Digital text as the new standard for all text: what this means and how to handle it.
<li>Should you burn your books (to stay warm through the winter), or do something else with them? What else?
<li>What doesn't kill you makes you stronger: the ascendency of the web (and how and why to write in that sphere).
<li>The contemporary writer and modern public life: why the reclusiveness of the writer (which once worked in our favour) is now a major impediment to creative engagement.
<li>Creative communities: how they work, what they offer, and why we should get involved.
<li>Ancestral roots and the creative spirit: (from the ancient Egpytians to William Blake to the tweeting blogger).
