\opening{Dear Deborah;}

Thanks very much for giving me extra time to prepare my submission. Below is a summary of my proposed professional development workshop.


\section{It was the best of times; it was the best of times\\Rediscovering the Creative Spirit in an Age of Uncertainty}

The contemporary age is one of tremendous upheaval and uncertainty for the literary arts. New technologies challenge established business practices. Nascent and rapidly emerging markets pose new questions about processes and products. Conflicted conversations about rights and the uses of creative commodity dominate an increasingly fractured landscape. Within this turbulent tumble lies the writer as artist: pressured by the exigencies of commerce, burdened by the minutiae of intellectual property law, increasingly hobbled by anxiety and disorientation.

The writer in Canada now feels at the whim of indifferent and unpredictable forces. The buffers which once protected professional writers from the messiness and incipient momentum of the market are now, for the most part, dismantled or disintegrating. Creative and professional paths that once were secure are now fraught with new obstacles. The sacred space of creative inquiry seems under threat. The artifacts of that inquiry have lost much of their meaning. The casual blog has vanquished the thoughtful book.

At least, this is how it seems to many writers working today in Canada: dark times, enemies at the gate.

But this is how all the great stories begin. Turbulence -- emotional, cultural, political -- is the source and fuel of creativity. The current age is thus a great gift. Artists and writers are now free, in the philosophical (and perhaps spiritual) sense, free to pursue the clamour and craft of their work, in a manner that we have not encountered before. Not since the audacious invention of writing itself.

This professional development workshop will invite professional writers to discover -- or rediscover -- the unrivaled adventure of creative work in the world today. The path forward is not labyrinthine but requires, rather -- like most daunting tasks -- that a small number of simplicities reveal themselves behind the swirl of turbulence. Workshop participants will learn about various technologies of creativity -- this, of course, is a pertinent and pressing matter -- but this workshop is not, primarily, another introduction to blogging, social networking, web content, and viral marketing. These are only the outer appearance -- the carapace, the shell -- of what amounts to a re-imagining of what it means to be a creative person in the world today.

This is a workshop about reclaiming the fundamental right of creative endeavour and choosing the paths that lead forward.

Freedom, adventure, opportunity: these are the watchwords of the contemporary creative professional. Every age calls its inhabitants to action. How do we know this? Writers tell us. How do they tell us? By facing their own crises of confidence, by wrestling with the emerging norms and practices of their time, by seizing the word as their instrument and their stand. Why should we expect our age to be any different? Why would we want it to be?

\subsection{Themes and Details}

\begin{itemize}
\item What's broken, why it's broken, and why we should not try (too hard) to fix it.
\item What creative freedom means today: new models for releasing your work in the wild.
\item Understanding and dealing with text as a commodity.
\item The meanings of Open, Free, Closed, and Proprietary (and the risks and opportunities offered by each).
\item "Free, as in beer": what's that all about?
\item Digital text as the new standard for all text: what this means and how to handle it.
\item Should you burn your books (to stay warm through the Canadian winter), or do something else with them? What else?
\item What doesn't kill you makes you stronger: the ascendency of the web (and how and why to write in that sphere).
\item The contemporary writer and modern public life: why the reclusiveness of the writer (which once worked in our favour) is now a major impediment to creative engagement.
\item Creative communities: how they work, what they offer, and why we should get involved.
\item Ancestral roots and the creative spirit: (from the ancient Egpytians to William Blake to the tweeting blogger).
\item It was the best of times; it was the best of times (no kidding).
\end{itemize}
