International Field School (Amazon)
===================================

### Calendar Description

Learners will engage in intensive interdisciplinary field study in the Amazon rain forest. They will participate in cultural and creative immersion activities, assist with community development and conservation projects, and contextualize their field learning by classroom-based analysis and critical reflection before and after their field experiences. 

Learners will develop interdisciplinary skills in creativity, academic inquiry, ecology and conservation, cultural awareness, environmental design, and community development. They will become familiar with various expressive modalities of the Amazon region (e.g. writing, music, movement, fine arts, materiality, theatre, storytelling, etc.) and will explore the application of those modalities in an integrative learning environment.
