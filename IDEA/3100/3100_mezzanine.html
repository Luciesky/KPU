<p>Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts 3100 is a course in which we focus on creativity, on making a claim for the fundamental right of intentional creative action. We explore the ancient and modern practices of creative endeavor (particularly as regards family and culture), the hurdles of creativity (as they involve craft and precision and clarity) and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that is to say, the long tradition of writers, poets, sculptors, dancers, craftspeople of all stripes, musicians, myth-makers, and so on). The course utilizes interdisciplinary methods and practices, which offer a single lens that moves across all domains of knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="clearfix">The IDEA Skill Set</h2>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s most helpful to come at interdisciplinarity in terms of a skill set. Thinking and acting in an interdisciplinary way is really a matter of looking at the process of learning. Instead of focusing on the &ldquo;content&rdquo; we might ask questions about how we identify, interpret, create, and communicate this content. These are process questions. Below are some examples of the kinds of considerations we will explore during our process.</p>
<h3>Creating a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Question</h3>
<p>The questions we ask tell us a lot about how we think, the assumptions we make and what we&rsquo;re willing to accept as answers. What is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; question? How do questions emerge? Where do they come from? How does a question evolve? How do we hold space for our questions and how do they &ldquo;work&rdquo; on us? We will discuss these questions about questions, and see where they lead us.</p>
<h3>Critical Thinking and Crap Detection</h3>
<p>We are often quick to believe what we read and what we hear, especially when it comes from sources that we deem &ldquo;authoritative.&rdquo; Teachers, journal articles, media, books, professors, parents, and peers all have their own take on what is correct and true. Who is right? How do we know what we&rsquo;re hearing is not false or misconstrued? What is true? From what perspective is it true? What other perspectives can be taken that are also true? What evidence is being used to support the claim? Is the evidence appropriate for the kind of claim being made? What ideologies, assumptions and beliefs are at play? How do they impact the interpretation of &ldquo;facts&rdquo;? And what are facts, anyway?</p>
<h3>Finding, Using and Evaluating Resources</h3>
<p>Resources are what we use to accomplish something. We have internal resources such as courage, empathy, compassion, self-awareness, mindfulness and so on to help us create, learn and work with the challenges of life. People in our lives such as teachers, peers, mentors, and guides also have skills, experience, and knowledge that can potentially help us accomplish our goals. As well, the internet, books and other sources of information are valuable resources. How do we know what resources we need to accomplish a goal? Are they internal, interpersonal, or codified? What are the means by which we access these resources? How do we know if the sources we&rsquo;re accessing are good or the right ones for our goal? How do we evaluate their quality?</p>
<h3>Communication (speaking, listening, writing, performing)</h3>
<p>Language is expressed verbally and non-verbally in a particular relational context of culture, values and past experience. Our ability to translate ideas into words and actions, move an audience into a compelling dialogue, or simply be present to someone else, requires an awareness of these contexts and good communication skills. How does a mindful and embodied presence shape how we speak and listen? How do we write articulately, persuasively, and with accuracy and authenticity? How do our values shape the way we communicate?</p>
<h3>Working in a Group</h3>
<p>Groups offer invaluable opportunities for personal development and routinely transcend the efforts of any one individual. The following elements are some of the important capabilities required for healthy group process:</p>
<ul>
<li>building trust and a culture of collaboration</li>
<li>attending to individual needs and the needs of the group</li>
<li>sharing responsibility</li>
<li>giving and receiving feedback</li>
<li>embracing and resolving minor conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of our class time will be spent in small and large groups exploring and developing these skills.</p>
<h3>Following Through on a Process</h3>
<p>Any creative process that generates new forms of knowledge (arts, sciences and otherwise) typically has a number of phases. These phases don&rsquo;t always happen in order and are not necessarily distinct events, but it&rsquo;s helpful to think about the ecocycle of creative work. First, there is the discovery of interest or passion. The question or idea may not even be fully formed at this point, but there&rsquo;s a spark that feels like it&rsquo;s worth following. Next, we immerse ourselves in the topic. We read, have conversations, mess around with different approaches. Basically, we commit to learning as much as we can about our passion. At some point we have consciously consumed as much as we can about the topic and we need a break from thinking about it. We let the questions incubate and trust that they are working under the surface in the dark soil. &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; eventually comes, perhaps after a long &ldquo;winter&rdquo;. Insights and breakthroughs emerge. Little shoots pop up out of the soil. We are careful to not jump to conclusions but instead create space for ideas and insights to slowly emerge through a process of articulating and capturing. In the last stages, we bring all the elements together in a creative synthesis and share the bounty of our harvest.</p>
<p>What is happening at each stage of the creative process? What are the challenges of each stage? How do we support the work that needs to be done in each phase? How do we manage our time in such a way that we are able to do creative work sustainably? Doing the preparatory work, looking for and taking opportunities, experimenting, being realistic about time, taking care of mind/body/heart/soul, and attending to other responsibilities all require good skills in managing our time. And how do we balance these various factors?</p>
<h3>Self-Awareness and Self-Evaluation</h3>
<p>Growing personally and professionally is a process that has no end point. Although growth is challenging and at times painful, growth is critical to finding meaning and vitality in our life and work. Living systems that come to an equilibrium with their environment &mdash; that stick with the status quo and are content living in their comfort zone &mdash; do not live for very long! For humans, growth requires self-evaluation, which in turn involves looking at our strengths and vulnerabilities, considering the evidence and feedback in these areas, identifying where we wish to grow, creating a game plan for how we plan to address our vulnerabilities, and celebrating our successes.</p>
<p>Self-assessment involves asking questions such about how we wish to grow. What is involved in growing in a given area? What opportunities can we find and/or create to grow? How do we take responsibility for working on ourselves? How does the feedback from others and the results of our attempts to develop tell us how we are doing? How do we decide what to do with the feedback we receive from others?</p>
<h2 class="clearfix">Our Basic Approach</h2>
<p>This course explores the many dimensions of interdisciplinary inquiry. The course is, for the most part, led by the initiatives and interests of students working individually and in groups. The course content will evolve as the course develops, but will include a diverse number of current interdisciplinary approaches within the expressive arts. These include creative writing, music, movement, fine arts, theatre, expressive arts therapies, storytelling, mythopoetics, photography, film making, etc. Additionally, students will explore potential academic and career directions within the cultural and social services sectors.</p>
<p>In this course we stake out the territory of the creative, inspecting the geology of its forms and ideals, finding our own individual places to homestead. Creativity involves the search for truth, yet also an awareness that truth and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do about it.</p>
<p>And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the foundation of all the arts and sciences.</p>
<h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
<p>The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regular attendance and dedicated participation. Because creativity is an interactive process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises, individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.</p>
<p>We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive, cut-throat, critical. Instead, we will direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each participant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile, especially at its inception, and we must be conscious of this fragility. Think about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers? Why do you think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or drawing, or reading their written work to others? We have, most of us, been the victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment. We have to be careful about this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.</p>

<h4>Other Stuff (that we'll think up as we go along)</h4>
<p>Much of the course content will be generated by students.</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>The interdisciplinary perspective is one in which the network of disciplines is the domain. If traditional disciplines are described as a network of nodes, the following structure outlines the interdisciplinary approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each traditional discipline is a node.</li>
<li>Each node is connected to every other node.</li>
<li>The nodes are connected by numerous (theoretically infinite) pathways.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary learners study the pathways.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with other disciplines, the study of the pathways (Interdisciplinary Studies) has its own set of guiding principles, which might be outlined as follows:</p>
<dl><dt>Translinearity</dt><dd>Focus on pathways and different perspectives (between and across fields, domains, curriculum, bodies of knowledge, networks and actor-networks, academic and social structures).</dd><dt>Integration</dt><dd>Focus on the shared characteristics of nodes, multiple sources and experiences, various settings, diverse and contradictory points of view, contextuality.</dd><dt>Hermeneutics</dt><dd>Focus on interpretation and meaning, analysis of verbal and nonverbal forms of communication, exploration and analysis of assumptions, presuppositions, pre-understandings, attention to the meaning of language. (The term <em>Hermeneutic</em> is derived from the mythological Hermes/Thoth: boundary-crosser, keeper of keys, god of trespass and wisdom, inventor of the arts and sciences.)</dd><dt>Optionality</dt><dd>Focus on auxiliary functions of domains and knowledge, transferability, redundancy, bricolage, wandering, accidents, boundary-crossing, maximal exposure to forking avenues.</dd><dt>Networks</dt><dd>Focus on nonlinearity, robustness, cascades, recursive links, black swans, interdependence, percolation, complexity.</dd></dl>
<p>Interdisciplinarity is a lens that moves across all domains. That lens might be called the node of Interdisciplinarity.</p>
<h3>Group Presentations</h3>
<p>Each participant will help develop, with two or three other class members, one or two group presentations. The schedule for presentations will be determined in class. Selecting a topic, and with prior instructor approval, each group will present for between 20 and 40 minutes. The presentations must provide an experiential component, a group discussion component, and an informational component. Additionally, each group must provide approximately equal presentation time to each of its members. Each group will also prepare a handout summary of their topic (with short reference bibliography, as required) to present to each member of the class as a professional resource.</p>
<p>The central idea of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities to practice interdisciplinary thinking, collaboration, and expression. As such, the group presentations should be interdisciplinary. Essentially, this means that you should try to use multiple presentation strategies and modalities. These might include (but are certainly not limited to) any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storytelling</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
<li>Music (playing)</li>
<li>Drumming</li>
<li>Singing</li>
<li>Dance</li>
<li>Movement</li>
<li>Sport</li>
<li>Ritual</li>
<li>Film (showing)</li>
<li>Film making</li>
<li>Photography</li>
<li>Web content</li>
<li>Craft work</li>
<li>Art making</li>
<li>Individual reflection</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Health practices</li>
<li>Creative process (any type)</li>
<li>Group communication</li>
<li>Cultural practices</li>
<li>Nature experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever possible (and workable), try to mix together multiple modalities into a single presentation. For example, you might ask the group to do some individual reflection using the modality of poetry, then create a series of movements based on the poetry, then work in small groups to talk about and share the process. Many configurations are possible. The trick is to choose an activity that you enjoy, then find a way to apply it to the content (suggested presentation topics will be discussed in class). Please do not create your group presentations using only written and/or spoken materials. In other words, don't just stand up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic. Utilize the energy of the group. Feel free to experiment with activities and modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand but which might, upon experiment, yield surprising connections and results. Be playful. Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage with the process in novel and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The presentations should (ideally) not be complete explanations or presentations of material. Feel free to play with challenging exercises, with impossible scenarios, and other conundra. The best presentations offer more questions than answers. They, are, essentially, gateways into the mysterious&ndash;which, as Einstein will tell you, is an important place to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The group projects are replicas, in miniature, of your involvement in the entire class. They are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.</p>

<h3>Assessment for Group Presentations</h3>
<h4>Class and Instructor Assessment</h4>
<p>After each presentation, time will be set aside for class peers and the instructor to assess and give feedback on the presentations. Each group will design a rubric and questions for us to use in assessing each presentation. This feedback can sometimes be the most valuable part of the performance for everyone involved. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to see what worked, what landed with the audience and what didn&rsquo;t. This conversation can help the audience articulate struggles, questions and insights about what makes for an effective performance. By designing a rubric and questions for the audience to contemplate (either during or after the performance, depending on the goals and the presentation), you invite everyone to reflect on the nature and purpose of group sharing and performance.</p>
<h4>Self and Group Assessment</h4>
<p>This course utilizes experiential learning approaches which depend upon student involvement and active participation. Accordingly, the following criteria are used to evaluate overall participation and engagement in the group presentations (and the class):</p>
<ul>
<li>Willingness to take appropriate risks and to challenge oneself.</li>
<li>Willingness to speak up and to lead.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Willingness to collaborate with others.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the group.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individual Projects</h3>
<p>Projects in this course entail three linked assignments and several presentations. The assignments may be comprised of any type of creative expression (writing, music, imagery, dance, movement, photography, health practices, craft, etc.). The central idea is for you to choose a specific theme or thread and explore it in some depth. We will discuss these projects at length in class. They are opportunities for you to discover and explore creativity in your own life. Each assignment is worth 25 per cent of your grade. However, as the three assignments are linked together thematically, another way to view this arrangement might be as a single project in three parts.</p>
<p>I do not prescribe a particular length or structure for the projects. These details are up to you. There is no upper limit on the length or complexity of the projects.</p>
<p>Each individual project will include a written self-assessment of at least 500 words. The self-assessment will include answers to the following questions (answers need not be itemized):</p>
<ul>
<li>What research did you do to prepare for this project? Research might include readings, investigative interviews, online searches, self-reflections, ruminations, and many other modalities.</li>
<li>What learning resources did you use? These might include books, articles, online resources, and so on.</li>
<li>Of the research and readings you undertook, what impressed you as being most interesting or relevant?</li>
<li>What kinds of experiments did you undertake with this project? What did you build, write, craft, or try? How did you spend your time, and how did it go? (Look at the criteria on the next page.)</li>
<li>What went well, where did you struggle, and how do you feel about the process you undertook during this project?</li>
<li>What were the best and worst moments of this project? What did you learn from these moments?</li>
<li>How might you have improved this project, of your experience of it?</li>
<li>What did you learn about interdisciplinarity while working on this project?</li>
<li>What did you learn about yourself while working on this project?</li>
<li>What will you remember about this project in five years?</li>
<li>How does what you learned apply to your studies at Kwantlen and to your sense of your future direction?</li>
<li>What advice would you give to others who might be undertaking a similar project?</li>
<li>What did this project mean to you? What might it mean for others?</li>
<li>Do you plan to continue this project further, or to work on similar projects in the future?</li>
<li>You learned something crucial in this project which you won&rsquo;t discover for a while. Make a guess now about what that might be.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>It is difficult (or at least different) to translate evaluation in an IDEA course into a letter grade. I prefer to speak about evaluation and assessment, not marks. Evaluation in this course takes several forms: I evaluate you, you evaluate me, you evaluate yourself, and you evaluate each other. I have started by describing a skill set. This is the focus of the evaluation. You need to demonstrate to yourself (and to me) that you have changed (that you have improved your skills) from the start of the course to the end of the course. It is that simple, in principle. Your level of improvement will translate to a letter grade using the following descriptors:</p>
<h3>A-/ A/ A+</h3>
<p>Has attained a high level of competency in all, or almost all, of the stated skill areas. This competency would allow the student to complete excellent interdisciplinary inquiry projects in any area. This would be recognizable by any facilitator and the peer group. The student is aware of any remaining area of skill vulnerability, has shown improvement in that area, has developed strategies for minimizing its adverse effects, and has a plan of action for personal and professional development.</p>
<h3>B-/ B/ B+</h3>
<p>Has attained a high level of competency in many (but not all) of the stated skill areas, or has attained moderate competency in all of the skill areas. This competency allows the completion of good inquiry projects. The student will have developed a plan of action for further development in those areas which need it.</p>
<h3>C- /C /C+</h3>
<p>Has attained a moderate level of competency in some of the stated skill areas or has attained a low level of competency in all of the skill areas. The student will recognize the deficiencies or concerns and will have discussed a plan of action to deal with the concerns.</p>
<h2>Learning Criteria</h2>
<p>The evidence for your learning will develop as a consequence of your involvement with many tools and learning contexts. The tools will include the development and utilization of criteria for evaluating yourself, your peers, and the works you read and create. The contexts include group work, your individual project, writing, presentations, and discussions. This course is a space for participating in a variety of formats and to work on those skills that need the most attention. Using the IDEA skill set as a guide, I will ask you to propose a grade for yourself. We will negotiate a grade that seems fitting, based on the evidence, using the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to the development of self-awareness.</li>
<li>Openness to interpersonal process.</li>
<li>Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.</li>
<li>Consideration of and responsiveness to others.</li>
<li>Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.</li>
<li>Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.</li>
<li>Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.</li>
<li>Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.</li>
<li>Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item: self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I feeling right now?</li>
<li>What am I thinking right now?</li>
<li>Why am I reacting in this particular way?</li>
<li>What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?</li>
<li>Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?</li>
<li>When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?</li>
<li>In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these questions as they apply to you. At the very least, you might wish to consider what you are currently working on in your life, in which direction your attention is drawn, into which of the innumerable themes of human nature you are now called to delve.</p>
<p>In my role as your instructor, I will be paying attention to how thoughtful you are in examining and responding to questions like those in the lists above. I will not be analyzing you, but rather noticing what kinds of things you do, what your reactions are to various situations. My goal in observing your behaviors and interacting with you is to assist you in developing greater self-awareness (and, by extension, greater empathy, creativity, and character).</p>
<p>I will use the lists above, as well as the assessment criteria listed for each assignment, to assess your overall participation in the course. I will not be evaluating your level of self-awareness but rather your openness to the process of developing your self-awareness.</p>
<h2>Grade Inflation</h2>
<p>Almost every semester there are students who do well on the assignments, complete all the associated learning goals of the course, participate well, and wonder why they do not receive a grade of one hundred percent (or 98, anyway). Here is the reason: almost every semester there are students who demonstrates a level of commitment that goes beyond the course requirement. Such students complete extra work, or hand in exemplary assignments, or undertake a significant amount of personal development in addition to the course expectations. Such students typically receive the highest grades.</p>
<p>If you do reasonably well in the course you will receive a reasonable grade. Very high grades are intended for extra or exemplary work. Unfortunately, over the past thirty years the post-secondary educational system in North America has participated in a process of grade inflation. Since the 1980&rsquo;s, the average grade for typical course work has been increasing by about 25 per cent each decade. Elevated assessments do not accurately reflect the work of most students. Even worse, grade inflation has caused many students to expect high grades for average work. I am not a overly stringent assessor, but I will not inflate grades artificially.</p>
<p>In this course a small number of students will (likely) receive high grades; most students will receive grades in the middle range; and a few students will struggle with lower grades. If you are uncertain about your assessment for a given assignment, or if you would like suggestions for how to improve your grade, please ask me for clarification.</p>
<p>If you wish to achieve a good grade, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show up for class &ndash; every class. This course depends on student engagement. (This becomes especially important during the final weeks of the semester.)</li>
<li>Be attentive and mindful to the various criteria listed for each of the projects and the course overall.</li>
<li>Take the initiative to plan and develop your projects and presentations. This course is (very likely) more fluid and spontaneous than you are used to. Your ability to manage your time, commitment, and energy is crucial.</li>
<li>Speak up in every class (review the criteria for group engagement and presentations).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t look for the right answer to a question or challenge. Instead, find the answer that is meaningful to you.</li>
<li>Ask for help if you need it.</li>
<li>Be attentive to the Kwantlen policies on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/__shared/assets/Honesty1432.pdf">academic honesty</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/policies/C-LearnerSupport/c08.pdf">plagiarism</a>.</li>
<li>Commit to your projects in a substantial way. Good projects take time. Rushed projects are obviously rushed.</li>
<li>Have fun. Authentic learning begins with joy.</li>
