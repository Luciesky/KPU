Much of what I see in this last project is you settling more comfortably into your own sense of how your creative process might lead you forward -- beyond requirements and criteria and performance. Good work. After all, that's the main point of the course: to help us discover and follow our own paths, and to follow those paths as we move out into the world. The creative path is, at heart, the path of all life. 

So: well done. I appreciate your commitment, clarity, and focus. Keep doing that (I'm sure you will). Thanks for being in the class and for making a strong contribution to our collective process.
