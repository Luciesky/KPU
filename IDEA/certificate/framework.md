### Characteristics

* Online component with digital portfolio and badges

* No fixed course requirements (depends on gap analysis).
* Personalized pathways built through collaboration with faculty mentors.
* Competency-based transcript (competencies mapped to actual learning).
* Competencies as core (as opposed to credits).
* Courses defined by amount of learning (not hours).
* No set course schedule or defined points for courses (learning communities format).
* Self-paced program.
* Experiential learning.

Each skill has a number of lessons (up to about 8). Competency is earned by learning a baseline number of lessons. Master is achieved by learning more. The workflow is competency, partial mastery, full mastery.
