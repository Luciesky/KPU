Post-baccalaureate Certificate Program
=======================================

Mentorship and Community Engagement
-----------------------------------

This program will provide an integrative and self-directed learning environment for learners to develop mentorship skills they can use in the workplace,  in their communities, and in their families. The program will be structured as a learning community in which individual learners will build their own pathways based on how much they already know, how they want to apply their skills, and how intensive they wish their program to be. 

 There will be no set classes in this program.  Instead,  learners will join a cohort during their participation in the initial one week intensive. With the help of a program mentor, the cohort will plan monthly meetings and activities based on their shared interests and challenges. In consultation with a program mentor, each learner will also develop an individualized plan that addresses how much skill development the learner needs to accomplish during the program. There will be no predetermined credit requirements, prerequisites, or learning activities; the program will be different for each learner. Projects will be based on skill demonstration and assessed using competency criteria. There will be no grades. Instead, each learner who successfully completes the program will receive a skills-based transcript that shows the mentorship skills they have achieved and what the learner can do with those skills. 

The program will have four elements:

* Initial one week intensive
* Cohort activities (approximately monthly) 
* Individual projects (some of which will include other members of the cohort,   courses from other programs, and similar customizations) 
* A practicum to demonstrate the skills learned

The program will emphasize the following characteristics:

* Online component with digital portfolio and badges
* Prior learning assessment and gap analysis
* No fixed course requirements (depends on gap analysis)
* Personalized pathways built through collaboration with faculty mentors
* Competency-based transcript (competencies mapped to actual learning)
* Competencies as core (as opposed to credits)
* Courses defined by amount of learning (not hours)
* No set course schedule or defined points for courses (individualized) 
* Self-paced program
* Experiential learning
* Broad acceptance of learning activities (independent study, learning communities, courses from elsewhere, etc.)
