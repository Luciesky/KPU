Post-baccalaureate Certificate Program
=======================================

Mentorship and Community Engagement
-----------------------------------

### Modular, skills-based curriculum

2 core modules: core and group

2 supplementary modules: one from the studentâ€™s area of expertise and one from a new area.

Mentorship practicum (skills-based, not time-based)

### Characteristics

* Online component with digital portfolio and badges
* Prior learning assessment and gap analysis.
* No fixed course requirements (depends on gap analysis).
* Personalized pathways built through collaboration with faculty mentors.
* Competency-based transcript (competencies mapped to actual learning).
* Competencies as core (as opposed to credits).
* Courses defined by amount of learning (not hours).
* No set course schedule or defined points for courses (learning communities format).
* Self-paced program.
* Experiential learning.
* Regular courses plus independent study, learning communities, courses from elsewhere, etc.

Each skill has a number of lessons (up to about 8). Competency is earned by learning a baseline number of lessons. Master is achieved by learning more. The workflow is competency, partial mastery, full mastery.

### The Zen of program development

These principles are approaches are borrowed both from the [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and [GitHub Zen](http://api.github.com/zen):

#### Github Zen:

Favor focus over features.
Anything added dilutes everything else.
Design for failure.
Practicality beats purity.
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.
Keep it logically awesome.
Encourage flow.
Speak like a human.
Approachable is better than simple.

#### Zen of Python:

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
