### Course Acronym, Number, and Title

IDEA 1400, Community Performance and Theatre Exploration

### Brief Description of Course

Learners will explore performance and theatre within an expressive arts context. They will develop performance skills and will present theatre productions to various communities within and beyond KPU.

### Program Fit

This course fulfills a long-standing initiative within IDEA to provide curriculum specifically focused on expressive arts performance. The IDEA steering committee has identified performance curriculum as a priority, IDEA developers have been working toward performance curriculum for some time, and learners have been requesting this kind of course since the inception of IDEA.

There is no similar course at KPU.

No prerequisites will be required.

### Faculty and Institutional Fit

This course utilizes specific modalities such as inquiry-based curriculum, reflective scholarship, intensive interaction, and interdisciplinarity. These approaches are all listed in the KPU Academic Plan as being foundational priorities. Additionally, the Academic Plan highlights the importance of values such as global citizenship, inspiration, compassion, imagination, and personal growth. These values are core elements of this course and of the IDEA philosophy in general. The Academic Plan further emphasizes skills such as effective communication, openness to diversity and inclusion, and creative and critical thinking. Again, these are all integral to the course and to the IDEA process. The broad goals articulated for KPU in the Academic Plan are embodied by this course and are reflected in the core processes and outcomes of the curriculum.

To illustrate the correlation between the course outcomes and the KPU Academic Plan, we have emphasized (below) the specific areas in which the learning outcomes for this course are aligned precisely with the KPU Academic Plan.

* _Explore and reflect upon_ performance and theatre experiences as opportunities for _developing the creative imagination, a critical sensibility, citizenship, and community engagement_

* Utilize the context of _mentorship_ and the activities of expressive arts performance to achieve _personal growth_

* Interpret and apply _diverse traditions_ of performance and theatre

* Develop the _creative imagination_ through performance, _mentorship_, and _community engagement_

* Improve skills of _communicating effectively_ in speaking, listening, writing, and performing

* _Join and contribute to_ an expressive arts _community_

* Create _interdisciplinary creative projects_ using strategies developed through exposure to a performance-based learning environment

We find similar correlations when we examine the KPU Strategic Plan. The core vision of the Strategic Plan is as follows, with emphasis added where the language matches the outcomes of the course under review:

* _Inspiring_ educators

* All _learners engaging in campus and community life_

* _Open and creative learning environments_

* _Relevant scholarship_ and research

* Authentic _external and internal relationships_

The Strategic Plan goes on to describe the importance of distinctive programming, innovative teaching and learning, experiential learning, enriched student experience, and purposeful community engagement. We have illustrated (below) how each of these core goals for KPU matches a core outcome for this course.

* _Distinctive programming_ corresponds to the unique performance-based curriculum of the course.

* _Innovative teaching and learning_ corresponds to the context of mentorship, creativity, and community engagement in the course.

* _Experiential learning_ corresponds to the learning environment of IDEA, which is entirely experiential.

* _Enriched student experience_ corresponds to the experiential learning environment focused on creativity, mentorship, engagement, and personal growth.

* _Purposeful community engagement_ corresponds to performances in the community (by the class) and a community of learning constructed by the learners (in the class).

The Arts Academic Plan is aligned with the KPU Academic and Strategic Plans, and we therefore see similar correlations in values, approaches, and goals. For example, the Arts Academic Plan specifically emphasizes goals such as the enhancement of experiential learning, the wider adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, the importance of preparing learners for global citizenship, and the crucial role of mentorship. All of these broad goals are specifically articulated in the course outline.

There is a high degree of symmetry between the stated goals of KPU, on many levels, and the articulated goals of this course. We believe that this course embodies, in a very fundamental way, the kind of institution that KPU has said it wants to be.

### Evidence of Demand

Research about the demand for post-secondary theatre courses among recent high school graduates has been conducted by one of our partners in the Surrey School District. This data, which includes information from all areas served by KPU (Surrey, Richmond, Delta, and Langley), shows that there is strong interest in post-secondary theatre curriculum. The majority of high school graduates who have taken theatre courses in high school seek experiential theatre courses in their post-secondary programs. However, at the moment, KPU does not provide such curriculum. Accordingly, there is strong demand for this course from incoming learners.

There is also strong demand from current learners at KPU. Every semester, the IDEA program engages in consultation with learners about program development (as IDEA is built by learners as well as faculty). In each of the last three iterations of this consultation (over the last three semesters), performance and theatre curriculum has been at the top of the list of requested new courses. In addition, students in past iterations of upper-level drama courses offered by KPU’s English Department have expressed a strong desire to take theatre courses at KPU.

The IDEA steering committee has also highlighted performance and theatre curriculum as priorities. Such curriculum fills a current gap in our offering. The discipline of Expressive Arts utilizes a suite of modalities that typically includes art, music, movement, writing, storytelling, craft, nature experience, drama improvisation, and theatre performance. At the moment, our curricular offerings include all of these modalities except theatre performance.

### Consultation

We have consulted with KPU's President, with the Dean of Arts, with our internal IDEA faculty cohort, with the Surrey School District, with colleagues among various departments at KPU, with colleagues teaching high school theatre curriculum, and with learners at KPU. All of these consultations have resulted in unequivocal support for the course.

Once the course is approved, we will meet further with high school theatre teachers to forge a working relationship that will allow us to perform for high schools. This initiative will be facilitated by the fact that many of the KPU students enrolled in the course will have taken theatre at local high schools. In addition, once we have developed dramatic material appropriate for elementary school students, we will approach elementary schools with the goal of performing for them.

We have begun consultation with the Gateway theatre about a collaboration involving theatre curriculum (with very positive results), and after the course is approved we will also consult with other community theatres. Working relationships will inevitably follow, as there is strong interest from local community theatres to collaborate with post-secondary institutions.

### Cross- or Interdisciplinary Potential

IDEA is, by definition and core purpose, an interdisciplinary initiative. (The “I” in IDEA stands for Interdisciplinary.) Accordingly, this course will be interdisciplinary. Moreover, the instructor for this course will be developing relationships with faculty in other departments with the goal of offering performances to enhance the student experience in other fields. For example, History students might benefit from performances involving historical events or dialogues from history. English students might benefit from performances of scenes from plays, stories, or entire plays they are studying in English classes. Sociology students might benefit from performances involving sociological situations. Anthropology students might benefit from performances involving cultural contexts or situations. Business students might benefit from performances and simulations of various situations (interviews, meetings, presentations, informal business situations, customer service, etc.) that can be dramatized effectively and thus analyzed and understood more effectively by Business students. In fact, a group of IDEA students could dramatize a given business situation in alternative ways to illustrate the pros and cons of various approaches to business.

This cross-disciplinary pollination can be extended to any field of inquiry at KPU. In each case, the IDEA instructor will consult with colleagues in such departments to maximize the integration of performances with the curriculum of the other course (including the alignment of assignments with performances, if desired).

Finally, the study of performance and theatre is inherently interdisciplinary. Learners will work on and study plays, rituals, theatres, and performances from various cultures and time periods, often integrating different disciplinary approaches (e.g. dramaturgical, psychological, sociological, cultural, historical) as appropriate to the demands of the given text to be performed and the anticipated performance context (e.g. location of performance and audience make-up).  The core approach — in texts, activities, and performances — is one that addresses theatre from across the world and throughout history. A global perspective, in other words

### Additional Considerations

This is a bare-bones theatre and performance course. All we need is a classroom to perform in and permission to perform in KPU common areas (indoors and outdoors). Ideally we would also like to utilize the Conference Centres (in Richmond and Surrey) as well as the Langley theatre for special performances, but even this is not absolutely required.

Some performances will be held off campus. These will be similar to regular field trips and do not require special consultations in risk management.
