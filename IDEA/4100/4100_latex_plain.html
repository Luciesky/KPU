            Basic Philosophy of the Course
            This  course  continues  the  foundational  work  begun  in  Interdisciplinary  Ex-
            pressive Arts 3100 or Mythological Narratives 3130,  in which students have
            explored the many dimensions of interdisciplinary inquiry.  The course is, for
            the  most  part,  led  by  the  initiatives  and  interests  of  students  working  indi-
            vidually and in groups.  The course content will evolve as the course devel-
            ops, but will include a diverse number of current interdisciplinary approaches
            within the expressive arts.  These include creative writing, music, movement,
            fine arts, theatre, expressive arts therapies, storytelling, mythopoetics, photog-
            raphy, film making, etc.. Additionally, students will explore potential academic
            and career directions within the cultural and social services sectors.
               As a reminder, and for new students (those who have not enrolled in IDEA
            3100), Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts refers to a specific set of educational
            activities,  goals  and  strategies.   Based  on  innovative  pedagogy  and  integra-
            tive approaches to learning, interdisciplinary studies involve the synthesis and
            synergy of various disciplines toward a cohesive, unified educational experi-
            ence.  Interdisciplinarity is much more than enrollment in courses from more
            than a single discipline. Authentic interdisciplinarity emphasizes the linkages
            between disciplines by focusing on contrasting and complementary aspects of
            diverse educational domains.
               Interdisciplinary  studies  encourage  students  to  develop  broader  intellec-
            tual skills,  greater facility for critical thinking,  and greater awareness of the
            social relevance of their education.  Interdisciplinary students have the oppor-
            tunity to develop exemplary skills in problem solving, insight, team-building,
            lateral thinking, and multi-modal learning styles.  Interdisciplinary strategies
            involve approaching an issue or problem from various perspectives. This typ-
            ically entails intellectual inquiries that range beyond the borders of any single
            discipline or domain. While still respecting the function of the boundaries be-
            tween domains, interdisciplinary approaches recognize that those boundaries
            are essentially arbitrary and do not always serve the goals of learning.  Global
            warming and the AIDS pandemic are two examples of contemporary issues
            that require interdisciplinary approaches.
               This course is about creativity, about making a claim for the fundamental
            right of intentional creative action. Within that context, we will explore the an-
                                            1

            cient and modern practices of creative endeavor (particularly as regards family
            and culture), the hurdles of creativity (as they involve craft and precision and
            clarity) and the great gifts we might receive from others of our creative kin (that
            is to say, the long tradition of writers, poets, sculptors, dancers, craftspeople of
            all stripes, musicians, myth-makers, and so on).  Throughout this process, our
            guiding archetype will be that of the trickster.
               In this course we stake out the territory of the creative, inspecting the ge-
            ology  of  its  forms  and  ideals,  finding  our  own  individual  places  to  home-
            stead. Creativity involves the search for truth, yet also an awareness that truth
            and fact are often provisional, and mythological; they are shapeshifters on the
            wide-open plain of creativity. We will explore what this means, and what to do
            about it.
               And, finally, the goal of the course (from my point of view, at least), is to
            have fun: to preserve and nurture the creative and imaginative spirit that is the
            foundation of all the arts and sciences.

            Learning Experiences
            The course will include a variety of learning experiences contingent upon regu-
            lar attendance and dedicated participation. Because creativity is an interactive
            process, much of the class time will be devoted to group experiential exercises,
            individual reflective tasks, collaborative endeavors, and practical assignments.
               We will create a collaborative environment in this class. We are not going to
            cobble together the type of group one often hears about in the arts: competitive,
            cut-throat, critical.  Repeat: we are not creating such a group.  Instead, we will
            direct our efforts toward building upon the individual strengths of each par-
            ticipant, finding ways for each of us to be self-reflective in terms of assessing
            our creative work, discovering a means of protecting the quality and integrity
            of our writing. The creative spirit is remarkably persistent, yet it is also fragile,
            especially at its inception,  and we must be conscious of this fragility.  Think
            about it: did you not experience, as a child, the strangulation of your creativity
            in school, by way of a culture of insensitive peers or teachers?  Why do you
            think hardly anyone feels comfortable singing in public, or dancing, or draw-
            ing, or reading their written work to others?  We have, most of us, been the
            victims of inappropriate feedback and judgment.  We have to be careful about
            this, in our course, so that we do not harm one another.

            Demonstration of Learning
            Assignments
            Three linked assignments and several presentations (see below) are required
            for this course.  These assignments may be comprised of any type of art ex-
            pression (writing, music, imagery, dance, movement, photography, etc.).  The
            central idea is for you to choose a specific theme or thread and explore it in
            some depth.  We will discuss these projects at length in class.  They are oppor-
            tunities for you to discover and explore creativity in your own life.
               For philosophical reasons, I do not prescribe a particular length or structure
            for the projects.   There is no upper limit on the length or complexity of the
            projects.
               The individual projects are worth 25 percent each.
                                            9

            Group Presentations
            Each  student  will  be  a  member  of  several  different  peer  groups;  each  peer
            group will present at least one mini-presentation (roughly thirty minutes each)
            on various topics.  Each class session after the second will involve presenta-
            tions,  with  one  presentation  from  each  group.   Class  time  will  be  given  for
            preparing  the  presentations.   The  structure  and  content  of  the  presentations
            will be discussed in class.
               The group presentations are worth a total of 25 per cent of your grade.
            Presentation Methods and Goals
            The central idea of the presentations for this course is to give you opportunities
            to practice interdisciplinary thinking and expression. As such, the presentation
            should be interdisciplinary.  Essentially, this means that you should try to use
            multiple presentation strategies and modalities.  These might include (but are
            certainly not limited to) any of the following:
               &#x2219; Storytelling
               &#x2219; Poetry
               &#x2219; Music (playing)
               &#x2219; Drumming

               Whenever possible (and workable),  try to mix together multiple modali-
            ties into a single presentation.   For example,  you might ask the group to do
            some individual reflection using the modality of poetry, then create a series of
            movements based on the poetry, then work in small groups to talk about and
            share the process.  Many configurations are possible.  The trick is to choose an
            activity that you enjoy, then find a way to apply it to the content (suggested
            presentation topics are listed below).  Please do not create your presentations
            using only written and/or spoken materials.  In other words, don&#8217;t just stand
            up at the front of the class and talk about the presentation topic.  Utilize the
            energy of the group. Remember that in interdisciplinary work divergences are
            valued as unique opportunities. So, feel free to experiment with activities and
            modalities that may not seem, on the surface, to be related to the topic at hand
            but which might, upon experiment, yield surprising connections and results.
            Be playful.  Allow yourself to laugh at yourself, to be embarrassed, to engage
            with the process in novel and interesting ways.
               In interdisciplinary work, riddles and puzzles are highly prized.  Accord-
            ingly, the presentations should (ideally) not be complete explanations or pre-
            sentations of material. Feel free to play with challenging exercises, with impos-
            sible scenarios, and other conundra. One way to think about this is to consider
            insoluble riddles, such as the one in Alice in Wonderland: Why is a raven like a
            writing desk?
                 &#8220;Have you guessed the riddle yet?&#8221; the Hatter said, turning to Al-
                 ice again.
                 &#8220;No, I give it up,&#8221; Alice replied. &#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;
                 &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea,&#8221; said the Hatter.
                 &#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said the March Hare.
                 Alice sighed wearily.  &#8220;I think you might do something better with
                 the time,&#8221; she said, &#8220;than wasting it in asking riddles that have no
                 answers.&#8221;
               The best interdisciplinary topics offer more questions than answers.  They,
            are essentially, gateways into the mysterious&#8211;which, as Einstein will tell you,
            is an important place to be:
                 The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is
                 the source of all true art and science.

            Evaluation of Assignments and Presentations
            My primary focus, as an instructor, is to assist you in developing your creativ-
            ity.  Grades are quite far down on the list of priorities for me.  I am focused on
            your engagement with the process, your commitment to your own work, the
            extent to which you show up, metaphorically, to be as present as you can be.
            These are evaluation criteria for me.
            Attendance and Participation
            The expectation is that you will attend all sessions and involve yourself in the
            class process. Your willingness to engage creatively with the learning process,
            to take appropriate personal risks, and to participate in group activities are all
            central to your involvement in this class.  Your emotional involvement in the
            class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

            Grade Inflation
            Every semester there are students who do well on the assignments, complete
            all the associated learning goals of the course,  participate well,  and wonder
            why they do not receive a grade of one hundred percent (or 98, anyway). Here
            is the reason:  almost every semester there are students who demonstrates a
            level of commitment that goes beyond the course requirement.  Such students
            complete extra work, or hand in exemplary assignments, or undertake a signif-
            icant amount of personal development in addition to the course expectations.
            Such students typically receive the highest grades.
               If you do reasonably well in the course you will receive a reasonable grade.
            Very high grades are intended for extra or exemplary work.   Unfortunately,
            over the past thirty years the post-secondary educational system in North Amer-
            ica has participated in a process of grade inflation. Since the 1980&#8217;s, the average
            grade for typical course work has been increasing by about 25 per cent each
            decade.  Elevated assessments do not accurately reflect the work of most stu-
            dents.  Even worse, grade inflation has caused many students to expect high
            grades for average work.  I am not a particularly stringent assessor; but I will
            not inflate grades artificially.
               The grades for the course will be distributed along a curve, with a small
            number  of  students  (likely)  receiving  high  grades,  most  students  receiving
            grades in the middle range, and a few students struggling with lower grades.
            If you are uncertain about your assessment for a given assignment, or if you
            wish to know where, roughly, you are along the distribution curve of the class,
            or if you would like suggestions for how to improve your grade, please ask me
            for clarification.
