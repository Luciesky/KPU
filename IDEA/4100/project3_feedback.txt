Hi;

I'm glad you enjoyed working on the final project -- and the other projects too, despite their hurdles and challenges. It seems that you managed to find the path forward, and that the projects helped you to accomplish the main goal of the course: to use creativity as a path of self-awareness and self-development.

You know enough by now about the importance of making time for creative work. Try to keep that in mind as you continue along. Life only gets more complicated and demanding -- not less -- so it's important not to lose sight of how best to balance out those demands with joyful experiences such as creativity.

Keep going...

Final grade: B+

Cheers.

Ross
