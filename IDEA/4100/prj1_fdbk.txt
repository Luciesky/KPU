It seems that you are making and finding the time to work creatively, and that you've made the essential connection between personal development, creative expression, and academic inquiry. That's what we're going for.

Keep going. As the semester progresses, you will be more pressed for time, and it will become tougher to find time for creative work. Don't let that creative work be pushed to the back of the queue; you need it, as you've discovered with this project, to help you understand yourself and your educational process. (Suggestion: find some good readings about your area of interest and include those readings in your next self-reflection.)

I enjoy seeing the creative play you bring to this work. Good for me to see, and good for you to do.
