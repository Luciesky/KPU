The Kwantlen community does not yet have a clear sense of what kind of an institution we want to be.

Lack of engagement at all levels.

Lack of clarity on institutional direction.

Supporting instructors who are especially good at teaching first-year (and giving them a mandate).

Helping students to make the transition from high school and to find pathways forward.

Learning goals need to be articulated more clearly and effectively.

Co-curriculuar and community-focused events shouldbe more available, encouraged, and supported.

Students need support in dealing with various kinds of stress (transitions, workload, etc.).

More effective assessments are needed to help stream and place students appropriately.

First-year students need help in choosing appropriate course workloads.

For courses with high-failure rates, Kwantlen should consider curriculum specifically tailored to first-year students (who have a multitude of special requirements: cultural, economic, familial, academic). A mentorship program would be helpful also.

Faculty communications with students could be improved.
Student encouragement should be improved.
The anxiety that many students experience is too high, especially for many first-year courses.

Students need to know how the system works and why it works in the way that it does.

Articulated first-year learning goals are essential, and should be developed and implemented by faculty who demonstrate an awareness of the specific mentorship needs of first-year students.

"The best teachers should teach first-year." How do we get there?

Students learn to seek instructors and courses based on engagement from instructors; but this is not always an approach that supports the best or deepest learning.

We need to get to the point where we can say that we are proudly open access, and that we provide the best first-year experience.

We need to implement more effective pedagogies and streams for first-year (university-ready and qualifying).

We should encourage out-of-class learning.

Unprepared students are not served well and do not perform well.

Writing and communications need to be emphasized more (and assessed better).

More effective course placement and assessment are needed.

More attention is needed to helping students prepare for success.

The question of quality should be explored in greater depth.

We need to scaffold a first-year experience (and visit high-school students to talk about this). This requires an institutional identity.

We should have intensive programs for first-year students.

We need new curriculum -- and, curriculum that is focused on student engagement, encouragement, and personal development.

We need a framework curriculum for first-year (a suite of courses).

There is an ethical question about the admittance of seriously unprepared students. What is our ethical obligation on the continuum between revenue generation and quality?

Support of students should be better. We should emphasize strategies that appropriately assess, stream, and support students (this should start before first-year).

Before the first semester begins, every student should get a peer mentor and a faculty mentor.

The overall theme is one of support, encouragement, streaming, and mentorship.

Scaffolding elements: mentorship before first semester; curriculum for first-year; early alert programming; ongoing peer and faculty mentorship.

Emphasis on care from instructors and advocacy from students.

We should develop partnerships with secondary schools.

We need to develop the Learning Centre (which students consistently report as being effective) so that students are more familiar with -- and use -- the services provided there.

Our programming needs to include parents.



Peer coaches need to be trained (as, probably, do faculty mentors).

Emphasize co-curricular
