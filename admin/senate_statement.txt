          Kwantlen is a new university with a promising future. We
	  have begun to reinvent ourselves, to imagine our collective
	  future as a vibrant, innovative, and multicultural
	  institution. But how do we get there? How do we nurture and
	  promote our new identity while also remaining attentive to
	  the traditions and practices of our history? How do we
	  bridge the ever-widening gap between the methods of
	  traditional education and the cultures of technology that
	  now drive our society (and our students) forward? How do we
	  fulfill our broad vision of what's possible within a context
	  of limited resources and strategic considerations? How do we
	  make it all work?

	  These questions are asked and answered at the Kwantlen
	  Senate. My aim is to join that conversation, to listen to
	  the ideas and goals of my peers, and to advocate for
	  renewal. I will honour Kwantlen's history while
	  carrying our strong vision forward.
