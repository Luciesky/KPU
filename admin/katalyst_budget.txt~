I have funded my professional career by way of support from non-academic funding sources. Typically, this has entailed building relationships with community partners (school districts, for example, or corporate partners) and finding several distinct contributions from different stakeholders. In writing books I have sought funding from the infrastructure provided by publishers and the Canada Council for the Arts. However, "academic projects" are specifically ineligible for funding from the Canada Council for the Arts (besides, I am trying to move into a different funding sphere). Moreover, my success with traditional publishing has not, of itself, increased my profile in the academic arena (and has not, therefore, increased my competitiveness for national research funding such as provided by SSHRC). However, my experience in securing funding for many projects -- from many sources -- is, I think, useful in this context. Much of what I have learned about funding heuristic projects can be applied to my proposal for a Katalyst grant. Accordingly, here is how I would fund this project if I was working "in the wild":

Digital Collaboratory for partners and participants: 


Domain registration, server hosting, digital infrastructure: $1,000

Coordination, facilitation, process management (interpersonal): $2,000

Coordination, facilitation, process management (online): $4,000

Events (three per year): $6,000

Reporting and Related Documentation: $2,000

Book: $25,000*

*$25,000 is the amount specified by the Canada Council for the Arts for grants to writers in the category to which I belong: mid-career writers who have published two or more books.
