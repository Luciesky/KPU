Katalyst Grant Application
Ross A. Laird, PhD

Summary of Proposed Research
============================

Over the past year I have worked with more than a thousand teachers, professors, educational administrators, and policy makers. I've consulted with primary and secondary schools, teacher training programs, colleges and universities, Parent Advisory Councils, health authorities, government ministries, and many other groups (examples: the Vancouver School District, the Richmond School District, the Abbotsford School District, the Coquitlam School District, the Langley School District, Vancouver Coastal Health, G.P. Vanier Secondary, Vancouver Technical Secondary, Palmer Secondary, Sutherland Secondary, David Thompson Secondary, Walnut Grove Secondary, Seaquam Secondary, Britannia Secondary, Windermere Secondary, Eric Hamber Secondary, Fraser Heights Secondary, the Adler School, the UBC Teacher Education program, the SFU Advanced Professional Studies Field program, the UFV Teacher Education program, L'Ecole Bilingue, and many others). I've presented at conferences and have faciliated facilitated workshops for parents, teachers, kids, counsellors, and government curriculum developers.

This work has focused on a single, pressing, and vexing theme: what to do about the recent changes in society -- particularly with regard to technology, and technology in education -- and how to reinvent education (perhaps using technology) to be more purposeful, relevant, and meaningful?

These consulting opportunities have come about by way of personal invitation. I have not undertaken any kind of marketing or promotion. It seems I have begun to develop a presence and reputation as an educational innovator and clear voice for sensible change. And yet, these activities are completely separate from my work at Kwantlen. I'd like to change that, and I'd like to use the Katalyst program to do it.

Over the past 25 years my scholarship has been nomadic and highly individualistic. My typical way of working has been to pursue my interest in a given area, compete for (and win) consulting contracts to work in that area, conduct my heuristic research, and write books and articles. But recently I've become interested in establishing a base for my scholarship, a means of integrating various professional threads into a more streamlined approach to enable me to write the next several books on my list of literary projects (I have written three books to date, one of which was a finalist for the Governor General's Award).

This is why I came to Kwantlen. I enjoy teaching as well, of course (and, if the student testimonials at kwantlen.ca/idea are any indication, I do a decent job); but research and scholarship -- and the writing that derives from those activities -- were my primary motivations. But, curiously, I have found it difficult to get much traction on these fronts. There seems to be no straightforward way to integrate my professional consulting and individualized research pursuits with the Kwantlen system of courses, departments, and programs. My educational activities at Kwantlen remain completely separate from my professional consulting work -- and the considerable success of that work -- out in the world. Now, since coming to Kwantlen, my situation involves two jobs rather than one, and I find that the demands of this dilemma occupy so much of my time and attention that I have less -- not more -- time for research and writing than I did before I came to Kwantlen. So, in fact, I am moving backwards.

The Katalyst program seems to be designed for precisely the kind of situation in which I find myself. I'm investigating an area of research in which I don't yet have a history of formal academic publication (though I have accumulated much professional expertise in this area). I am working in an interdisciplinary way, among a wide diversity of professionals both internal and external to Kwantlen (I've worked with every Faculty at Kwantlen on themes related to technology and education; and, as mentioned above, I've worked with many external partners.) I'm seeking to establish a research record that will enable me to be competitive in applying for future external funding with agencies such as The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and other national organizations. Essentially I'm trying to reboot my research through a new venue -- academic research funding -- that I have not previously pursued.

For example, SSHRC offers several grant programs for which my research is ideally suited. Insight Development Grants "enable the development of new research questions, as well as experimentation with new methods, theoretical approaches and/or ideas" [1]. Moreover, digital media has been identified by SSHRC as a Priority Area [2], and as my research is precisely relevant to digital media, I am in an excellent position to pursue SSHRC funding for my project. Similarly, SSHRC's Innovation, Leadership and Prosperity Priority Area" responds to the complexity, diversity and creativity of the new knowledge paradigm of the 21st century" [3]. Again, these are the themes of my research. And, as my research bridges the academic community with the community at large (through research conducted with learners, teachers, parents, and so on), my project fulfils the Knowledge Mobilization priorities of SSHRC by facilitating "the multidirectional flow of social sciences and humanities knowledge among researchers and between the campus and the larger community" [4].

By taking advantage of opportunities such as these, and by seeking help from academic research mentors at Kwantlen (to find further opportunities), my Katalyst proposal is intended to "form the basis for future applications to provincial, national, and international funding agencies".

With regard to the specific form of my research, the "problem or issue to be addressed" is twofold:

1. I am trying to bring my ongoing research to Kwantlen.
2. I am trying to enhance and deepen my work with others to find ways of improving education.

I propose to develop a heuristic research project, at Kwantlen, for investigating the lived experience of educators, learners, and parents as they navigate the transformative changes underway in education. (I am already conducting the research; what I'd like to do is bring it to Kwantlen.) The emphasis of the project will be on the tension between traditional educational approaches and new educational paradigms. The research will be conducted through interviews, narrative contributions by co-researchers (such as learner self-reflections), and reflections by me about the experience of consulting and working in this area. The process and results of the research will be collected together into an evolving digital collaboratory and then into a narrative nonfiction book intended for a general audience.

Detailed Description
====================

I have achieved excellent success in my previous professional (funded) and academic (non-funded) research in creativity and culture. My doctoral research project won the Union Institute's Sussman Award for Academic Excellence (the university's highest academic award), was adapted into a best-selling book, and was short-listed for the Governor General's Award (the highest arts award in Canada). The sequel to the creativity project was a heuristic investigation of the creativity of mythology, which in turn led to my involvement with the Canada Council as jurist for the Governor General's Award, jurist for Canada Council Literary grants, member of the National Council of the Writer's Union of Canada, and my ongoing involvement with the Writers' Union of Canada in the capacity of professional development consultant. Overall, my research projects in creativity have turned out well and have led to many positive outcomes (including my arrival at Kwantlen).

My proposed project continues my investigation of creativity but is now focused on a new context: education. The landscape of education has changed more rapidly in the past decade than in the previous hundred years. New technologies challenge established norms. Emerging practices promise new modes and methods. Cultural, economic, and social changes encourage (and perhaps even demand) a comprehensive review of what education is, and what itâ€™s for. We are -- to put it mildly -- living through an age of educational destruction and renewal.

Educators inherit a set of old and discredited practices (lecture, control of process, authority) that are ingrained into the culture of teaching by two hundred years of what might be called industrial education, in which content delivery is the primary role of the educator. The reason I am the teacher in my creativity class (or my mythology class, or my writing class) has everything to do with the implied endorsement that I know more about these subjects than anyone else in the room. The truth of this endorsement is essentially irrelevant; what's important is the perception that my knowledge counts. But it doesn't. At least not as much as it used to. My ability to teach is no longer hinged upon my knowledge of a given subject. This is especially true in the contemporary educational landscape, in which learners have immediate access -- via the web -- to repositories of knowledge that are far greater than anything individual educators can hope to provide. Everything I might say in the classroom, about any subject in which I am perceived to be the expert, can be found more easily and quickly on the web. And the context of that knowledge -- on websites, in videos, linked to countless other snippets of information -- is a more robust delivery system than me speaking at the front of the room. In a knowledge contest between a teacher and a learner with a browser -- even a learner with no knowledge of a given subject of the teacher's expertise -- the learner would win every time. Every single time: quicker, more complete, easier.

This is the "full 'problematic' underlying the investigation": in this new environment of teaching, what is my job?

My proposed investigation will explore the experience of educators, parents, and learners ("students" is a more traditional but less accurate term) as the educational environment shifts toward customized learning environments and digital facilitation. I'll examine how contemporary educators are helping learners build contexts for their knowledge, assisting learners in leveraging information into wisdom (whatever that means for a given field), navigating the sea of information, promoting synthesis and integration, watching and helping learners build their own skills, promoting communication and people skills, and so on. Essentially, I am interested in discovering how emerging models of education cajole from learners a sense of what their educational journey means. (In the world of my professional activities, what something means is a matter involving implications and understanding. But in the academic world, the notion of meaning varies among disciplines. In the academic context, my project might be classified as interdisciplinary hermeneutics.)

The pressure to learn -- and to keep learning -- is going up. Issues such as climate change, political and economic instabilities, and transformations of technology all require that learners know how to learn. They need greater adaptability, a stronger instinct to question, more creative independence, and the ability to bootstrap ways of being in the world without help from experts and authorities. Crowd-sourcing, digital collaboration, and grassroots community activism on the web are all transforming and integrating educational initiatives with social and cultural themes. My research will explore this landscape and its implications.

Methodology
===========

I plan to conduct a heuristic research project into the lived experience of educators, learners, and parents as they navigate the transformative changes underway in education. The emphasis of the project will be on the tension between traditional educational approaches and new educational opportunities: what to keep and what to discard, what works and what doesn't, what is lost and what is gained, and how best to make it all work. This project is fourth quadrant research [1], which lends itself well to heuristic approaches. The fourth quadrant describes areas of research in which sudden, unpredictable, and large-scale fluctuations tend to happen (but happen unpredictably). One recent example of this phenomenon is the market crash of 2008. Fourth quadrant -- or "black swan" [2] -- situations typically involve a known and steady history of events (such as 200 years of industrial education), the sudden emergence of turbulent change (such as that brought to education by technology), and groups of people biased toward (or against) particular outcomes (such as educators and learners and their divided views about technology in education). The proposed research project meets the criteria for fourth quadrant research, for which traditional statistical models are not well-suited. Accordingly, my research will be heuristic [3].

Heuristic research involves the "search for the discovery of meaning and essence in significant human experience. It requires a subjective process of reflecting, exploring, sifting, and elucidating the nature of the phenomenon under investigation" (Douglass and Moustakas 40). This collaborative research project will examine the inner lives and transformations of the participants (who will be co-researchers) as well as the inner life and transformations of the lead researcher (me). These experiences will be documented through various means: interviews, video narratives, creative projects, community events, digital documents, and so on. It's important to note that heuristic methods move beyond models of objective researcher and of subject and object. The heuristic perspective is one in which all participants are co-researchers, all phenomena are perceived in reciprocal relationship with the researchers (I influence what I study; what I study influences me), and all approaches seek integration and meaning. In this sense, heuristic research is a methodology in which all things are connected.

In the work of Douglass and Moustakas, the heuristic methodology is described as a means to "obtain qualitative depictions that are at the heart and depths of a person's experience -- depictions of situations, events, conversations, relationships, feelings, thoughts, values, and beliefs. A heuristic quest enables the investigator to collect ... the raw material of knowledge and experience from the empirical world." Heuristic research focuses on direct first-person accounts of "individuals who have directly encountered the phenomenon in experience... Whereas phenomenology encourages a kind of detachment from the phenomena being investigated, heuristics emphasizes connectedness and relationship" (38).

Part of the project will involve building and developing a digital collaboratory to collect first-person accounts of experience, to build connectedness across a wide community, and to foster relationships. This approach has been used at hastac.org (The Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory) and Berkeley's Townsend Humanities Lab. Co-researchers (educators, learners, parents) will contribute to the collaboratory, will post insights and challenges, and will allow website visitors to track the development of the project in real time. Involvement in the digital collaboratory will be offered as an option in Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA) courses at Kwantlen. In these courses learners have the opportunity to customize assignments and projects. For those wishing to participate in the research, assignments will involve contributions to the digital collaboratory (self-reflections, videos, narratives, etc.). This integrative, co-researcher approach embodies the values of crowd-sourcing and individual autonomy that define the new cultures of technology and the emerging ethos of education. (Learners who participate in the collaboratory will not be paid but will, rather, earn course credit for their participation.)

The research content for the digital collaboratory will be open content, and release forms will be used as required. The research content intended for publication in the book (of research results) will, for the most part, be adapted for anonymity (again, release forms will be used as required). This is the approach that I have used in my previous heuristic research and which I have used extensively in my new book on addictions, based on my work as a clinical supervisor in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. This book includes material -- gathered from hundreds of people -- about their experiences of addiction. All personally-identifying content has been removed from this material.

My role will be to facilitate the creation of these research artifacts in the context of my ongoing work with educators, learners, and parents. I am already doing this now, as a professional consultant to schools, parent groups, social service agencies, and so on. I facilitate an event, I write about it, I encourage and hear from participants, I have conversations, things move along. So, the research is already underway. As I mentioned at the outset, I'd just like a way to bring my activities more formally to Kwantlen.

Anticipated Outcome
==================

"Katalyst funding is primarily for new scholars wishing to make a significant start on their research career, and for experienced scholars changing research direction into new fields."

I am an experienced, award-winning scholar, but my scholarship has taken place mostly outside of academia. So, my experience does not precisely fit the categories above. (This is a typical problem with integrative and interdisciplinary scholars and scholarship: the vexing question of where it fits.) On the one hand, I am not a new scholar nor am I changing research direction. On the other hand, I am doing both of these things: I am new to traditional academic research and I am conducting research in an academic field (education) in which I have no previous formal academic record (but I do have extensive professional experience). I am undertaking a kind of migration toward the academic sphere. I'm not starting out nor changing tracks but rather exploring a different venue and ways of integrating my nomadic activities within an established academic framework.

For the past several years I have been providing consulting services to schools, universities, and other educational institutions on topics related to educational renewal. This work involves the interwoven themes of pedagogy, creativity, technology, culture, change management, and childhood development. I entered this area of work as a consultant building upon my 25 years of experience in social services (as a counsellor and clinical supervisor) and education (as a facilitator and professional development consultant). Until recently, I pursued this work outside the sphere of my academic interests; but in the last few years, as I have facilitated an increasing number of workshops for teachers and professors in an educational landscape increasingly fraught by questions of what to do about changes in technology and culture, I find myself in the timely position of knowing quite a bit already about a topic of great academic and public interest.

This project will help me to integrate my professional activities with my academic interests and will promote educational renewal at Kwantlen and in the community. My project is entirely focused on Knowledge Mobilization: connectivity, the spread of knowledge, community diffusion, implementation of innovation, social change [1].

Explanation of Interdisciplinary and/or Collaborative Nature of Project
=======================================================================

I find myself in an unusual and interesting position at Kwantlen. I am a qualified faculty member in four academic areas (Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts, Creative Writing, Educational Studies, and Communications), a faculty professional development consultant (in Learning Technologies), and an administrator (I am the Co-Director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research). The accumulated momentum of these various positions, and the ways in which my various roles interact, has led to a situation in which I do not have a fixed home at Kwantlen but rather float across, between, and within many different disciplines. I am a homeless wanderer at Kwantlen. 

One of the many things I have discovered in my travels across the hinterland of Kwantlen is that many people (faculty members, learners, administrators) seek a more engaged, transformative, responsive, and digital future for their academic pursuits. In my role as a consultant for Learning Technologies I have facilitated a number of workshops on new possibilities in education, the evolution of digital collaboratories, the migration of knowledge toward digital formats, and the rise of digital publishing. At each of these workshops I have witnessed the strong motivation from faculty members, learners, and administrators to reinvent what it means to teach and to learn, to leverage their knowledge into the online sphere, and to find serious, purposeful playfulness in the digital landscape.

The research project will involve faculty members at Kwantlen, educators in the community, learners, parents, and administrators in a project to achieve their aims. Kwantlen community members would come from various disciplines. I have already received strong indications of support from representatives of Criminology, Anthropology, and Sociology (in the Faculty of Social Sciences); from Modern Languages and English (in the Faculty of Humanities); from Marketing, Human Resources, and Communications (in the School of Business); from Biology (in the Faculty of Science); from the Faculty of Design, from the Faculty of Trades and Technology, and from several departments from within the Faculty of Academic and Career Advancement. I have also received similar indications of interest and support from Kwantlen's Library, from the Office of Research and Scholarship, from Learning Technologies, from the bookstore, from the Counselling department, from the Kwantlen Student Association, and from various other non-academic units. The entire educational community -- not just at Kwantlen, but everywhere -- is grappling with the challenges and opportunities that lie before us. This project will involve participants from all of the above areas, and will be an interdisciplinary, community-based, non-aligned, non-partisan approach to addressing challenges and maximizing opportunities.

As noted above, the roles of these various co-researchers offer many possibilities: learners working on creative projects on themes of educational challenge and renewal; faculty members reflecting upon their experiences as educators; parents attending and reflecting upon events in the community; administrators discussing the challenges and opportunities that lie before them. The task of the lead researcher (me) will be to facilitate and integrate these various activities into a digital collaboratory and a book.

The individual activities that co-researchers choose will depend on their own interests and ideas. Again, heuristic research is not so much about the lead researcher (me) determining the exact structure and evolution of the project. I will provide the context, the basic framework, the questions -- but co-researchers will enter the project with their own goals, aims, and ideas. This is an important clarification. Traditional academic research seeks to limit variables and uncertainty; but in my research, I seek to expand variables and uncertainty. The future of education is a landscape of extreme uncertainty. No fixed structure of inquiry (with firm numbers, set approaches, and fixed steps) will be sufficient to address the current challenges. What's required is a spirit of openness, collaboration, receptivity to surprises, comfort with uncertainty, and adaptability.

In non-academic contexts we might refer to this approach as purposeful play. In the academic context, the approaches of Physics are useful illustrations of what I'm talking about. Physicists build a framework (a supercollider, for example) and mix things together under conditions of extreme turbulence and uncertainty. Subatomic particles hurtle toward one another, crash together with unpredictable results, and the physicists interpret the results. Then they write about their experiences and try to derive a coherent picture of what they have experienced. The particles play a foundational role in this process, but the interpretations undertaken by the physicists are the key to making sense of what it all means. This is similar to what I am doing. I provide a framework (a research project with invitations to participate from among a broad cohort), I mix things together (people collaborating as they hurtle toward their educational future), and I see what happens. Then I interpret the results (using heuristic methods) and I write them up (online, and later in a book).

Plans for Communication of Research Results
===========================================

Communication of the processes and products of this project will begin on day one, with the launch of the digital collaboratory. Members of the broad community will be able to read about, and participate in, the conversations and sub-projects of the co-researchers. Community events will also be held (in schools, at community centres, at Kwantlen) as the research evolves, and each event will contribute more material to the collaboratory. An online community will develop, with the research at its core. 

As the project reaches the stage of formal publication of results, a book will be published. The book will be made available in print (on-demand) and several digital formats as well as a full text web version at the digital collaboratory. The book will be intended for a general audience -- as my other books have been. I am very interested in open access to information and the use of scholarship to promote the public good. Accordingly, the results of this research are intended to provide useful information and insight to general readers, parents, educators, and learners.

In conjunction with the publication of the book, I will present at various conferences. (I am already presenting at many educational conferences.)

Budget justification
====================

I have funded my professional career by way of support from non-academic funding sources. Typically, this has entailed building relationships with community partners (school districts, for example, or corporate partners) and finding several distinct contributions from different stakeholders. In writing books I have sought funding from the infrastructure provided by publishers and the Canada Council for the Arts. However, "academic projects" are specifically ineligible for funding from the Canada Council for the Arts (besides, I am trying to move into a different funding sphere). Moreover, my success with traditional publishing has not, of itself, increased my profile in the academic arena (and has not, therefore, increased my competitiveness for national research funding such as provided by SSHRC). However, my experience in securing funding for many projects -- from many sources -- is, I think, useful in this context. Much of what I have learned about funding heuristic projects can be applied to my proposal for a Katalyst grant. The only difference between my previously-funded projects and the Katalyst project (in terms of funding) is that the Katalyst funding is from one place (Kwantlen) rather than spread across several players. Accordingly, my projections for an "integrated, single-partner project" are as follows:

Digital Collaboratory for partners and participants: $8,000

The digital collaboratory will involve a number of interlocking steps: securing cloud-based server space, infrastructure, and applications (Ruby on Rails, Git version control, LAMP stack, secure shell, AWS access, JQuery, and related tools); building a collaboratory application, deploying and tracking releases and content; building a "procial" (professional and social) semantic layer; creating and moderating content; distributing content through various web channels (Posterous, Tumblr, Twitter, etc.), and facilitating the synthesis of the online research content into the book.

Kwantlen's existing technology infrastructure cannot provide the above requirements. The collaboratory must be built outside the Kwantlen technology ecosystem, in a cloud-based environment (such as heroku.com) that is designed for this type of application. The budgetary requirements for cloud-based applications do not require the purchase of new computers or related equipment; fees are based on access and data use (and are listed in the next section). Accordingly, the figure of $6,000 represents the amount of time and digital expertise required for me to complete the steps listed above. The total time required is roughly 100 hours.
 
Domain registration, server hosting, digital infrastructure: $1,000

This includes fees for securing the domain name and server space, covering the costs of data access and transfer (website traffic), and enabling web services for proper functioning of the collaboratory (backup, for example). The above figure is an estimate. Many factors influence costs such as data access and transfer. But this is a very conservative estimate. Unless the collaboratory becomes the most popular website in Canada (which would be a good thing but is highly unlikely), data transfer and related costs are unlikely to be more than a few hundred dollars. 

Coordination, facilitation, process management, events (interpersonal): $3,000

This includes personal meetings, interviews, discussions, collaborations, and relationship-building with Kwantlen partners, community partners, and parents (the cost for interpersonal work with learners will be integrated with IDEA courses and therefore does not require added funding).

Coordination, facilitation, process management, events (online): $3,000

This includes online meetings, interviews, discussions, collaborations, and relationship-building with Kwantlen partners, community partners, and parents (the cost for online work with learners will be integrated with IDEA courses and therefore does not require added funding).


Co-researcher participation

As mentioned previously, co-researchers will not be paid. Instead, their involvement will either be on the basis of earning credits in IDEA classes or as volunteers interested in the themes of the study and seeking ways of navigating the new landscapes of education. Emphasizing the importance of volunteerism is a key aspect of technology culture, and my experience so far (with the previous consulting I have done in this area) is that volunteers readily step forward. Some are searching for communities of intentional practice, some are seeking support in dealing with change, some are simply curious about the evolutionary elements in play. But whatever their individual reasons, I have found it very straightforward to find sufficient numbers of people to participate in this work. 

Ironically, the challenge is not so much to find the people but rather to deal with the avalanche of interest. But this makes sense. After all, when Wikipedia first began, most people could not understand why anyone would volunteer time to contribute. Now that Wikipedia boasts millions of contributors (each of whom volunteers, on average, a few hours each week), the detractors are still scratching their heads but are no longer able to claim that volunteerism is hard to encourage. It's not -- especially with pressing social issues, and increasingly enabled by technology. More and more, the web is an environment of volunteer contribution based on personal investment. As my project is focused on a subject of great personal interest to many people, I will depend upon volunteerism for the collection of research data.

I already depend upon volunteerism. I have begun a digital collaboratory for my consulting work with educators and parents, and I receive many contributions, reflections, questions, ruminations, and resources on a continuing basis. All that's required for the research project is to build a similar collaboratory specific to the project.

Total cost for paying co-researchers: $0


Book: $25,000

This includes planning, outlining, synthesizing and interpreting the data, writing various drafts, fact-checking, editing, copy-editing, designing, typesetting, digitizing (in multiple formats), and arranging for publication. Writing a book is a substantial effort and requires a significant investment in time and focus. I have determined $25,000 to be the appropriate amount for this portion of the project. $25,000 is the amount specified by the Canada Council for grants to writers in the category to which I belong: mid-career writers who have published two or more books. Canada Council grants for writers are intended to provide "Canadian authors (emerging, mid-career and established) time to write new literary works." This is precisely what I will be doing, and the Canada Council's "industry-standard" is the best guide to budgetary projection for this type of work.


Total:

The total projected cost of the project is $40,000.


Timeline:

The timeline for this project is two years.


Research Grant Application History
==================================

I have entered traditional academia only recently, after a 25-year career as a consultant, educator, artist, and author. My career has been mostly what I call "in the wild": bidding for and earning contracts, competing with other consultants and educators, working creatively to spread ideas, collaborating with a wide range of professionals. I have achieved a strong track record in my career without ever having applied for a "research grant" in the sense that (I think) this section of the form requests. I imagine the intended criteria for this section involves applications for funding from organizations such as the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). My funding has never come from such sources. Instead, my research has been undertaken with support from organizations such as The Canada Council for the Arts, Heritage Canada, the BC Ministry of Health, Corrections Canada, and many private corporations. These types of organizations do not typically use the term "research grant". Instead, they use words such as competition, contract, and bid. Essentially, this is the landscape with which I am most familiar and in which I have built my track record of success. (The absence of the word research in these contexts does not mean that I have not conducted research. It means that my research has not followed traditional channels.)

I assume that this section of the application is primarily intended to determine whether the researcher has a history of successful peer review (and, by implication, how much research funding the researcher has raised). As my research has taken place in an environment distinct from the pathways of SSHRC and related agencies, it may be useful for me to illustrate my success with some examples of the context of peer review and funding in which I typically work.

Peer Review in the Arts

I am a professional writer. I have written three books on interdisciplinary subjects (creativity, myth, culture, addictions). My first book evolved out of my doctoral research project, which was a heuristic study of creativity. The dissertation, which won the Union Institute's Sussman Award for Academic Excellence (the university's highest academic award), was adapted into a best-selling book and was short-listed for the Governor General's Award. In the environment of professional writing in Canada, a short-list for the Governor General's Award is the highest peer review accolade one can receive.

The success of my first book led to a second, which was published by Canada's premier literary publisher, McClelland and Stewart. Publication by M&S is a type of peer endorsement for Canadian writers (an endorsement from the gatekeepers of Canadian literature). Most of Canada's historical literary figures have published with M&S.

My ongoing success as a writer has led to my involvement with the Canada Council for the Arts. I was asked to be a jury member for the Literary Grants program and for the Governor General's Award. One cannot apply for such positions; they are by invitation only, from the foremost arts funding agency in the country. Essentially, my participation on the Governor General's Award jury (in 2008) was an endorsement from the government of Canada that I am competent to assess the literary merit of the best writers in Canada. This is a very strong "peer review" endorsement.

One more example: last year I responded to a call, from the Writers' Union of Canada (for which I have served on the National Council), to compete for a Heritage Canada contract to be one of two professional development consultants for professional writers in Canada. This was a national call, open to any professional writer. My successful bid is a strong endorsement of my role within the writing community and a clear indication that writers value what I offer. (This Heritage Canada project was intended to help writers navigate the evolving digital landscape of publishing. In many ways, writers are grappling with the same challenges as educators.)

From readers, writers, publishers, and from the government of Canada, I have consistently received strong endorsements. My peers -- at every level -- have acknowledged that I make an important contribution.

None of this work has involved "research grants" and pathways of publication in scholarly journals. Instead, my research has been published in the books and articles I have written based on my experiences as a researcher of creativity and personal development. My work has been published or reviewed in most major publications in Canada (The Globe and Mail, Maclean's, The Toronto Star, The Ottawa Citizen, The Hamilton Spectator, The Vancouver Sun, etc.), I have appeared on television and radio many times, and my writing and research continue to evolve (I am now working on a fourth book).

The funding for these projects has included book advances, jury fees, literary grant funding, and contract fees. The total amount over the past few years is roughly $100,000.

Peer Review in Social Services

I have been a professional counsellor and clinical supervisor to social service agencies for many years. I have worked with hundreds of social service agencies and thousands of individuals. I have presented at more than 100 conferences, have facilitated hundreds of professional development projects, and have worked hard to establish a strong reputation for professionalism. In 2003 I earned the Communications Award of the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors for the heuristic research of my first two books. This year I will publish a third book, on addictions, that continues and deepens that research.

Peer Review in Education

For the past several years I have provided professional development services to elementary schools, secondary schools, community colleges, vocational schools, teacher training programs, teaching associations, school districts, parent groups, student groups, and universities (in 2010-11 I provided professional development consulting for faculty at Kwantlen, through my role as consultant for Kwantlen's Learning Technology department). This work continues to grow and expand in scope; during the past few months I have worked with more than 1,000 educators in many institutions (repeating the examples for earlier: the Vancouver School District, the Richmond School District, the Abbotsford School District, the Coquitlam School District, the Langley School District, Vancouver Coastal Health, G.P. Vanier Secondary, Vancouver Technical Secondary, Palmer Secondary, Sutherland Secondary, David Thompson Secondary, Walnut Grove Secondary, Seaquam Secondary, Britannia Secondary, Windermere Secondary, Eric Hamber Secondary, Fraser Heights Secondary, the Adler School, the UBC Teacher Education program, the SFU Advanced Professional Studies Field program, the UFV Teacher Education program, and L'Ecole Bilingue, among others).

Overall, I have earned roughly $200,000 over the past six years (the length of time requested by this application) providing educational consulting services.

A Different Path

In composing this application I've struggled with how much of my professional background to include, as my path has been purposefully meandering and very different from the academic norm. I've consistently wondered how much of my career experience will "count" -- that is, how will my diverse, extensive, and unusual career experience be evaluated in this process? On the one hand, you could say that I have no track record of successful research grants; after all, I've never applied for a SSHRC grant (for example). On the other hand, I do have a strong track record, but one that's in a different arena than traditional academia. I've simply chosen an alternate route, in some ways a more challenging route, in which professional competition and research as practice are the norm. 

My anxiety about legitimacy is a bit ironic. SSHRC defines a "record of research achievement" as "any identifiable contributions made by applicants to the advancement, development and transmission of knowledge." By these criteria, I do indeed have a strong track record: I have made extensive contributions to several fields, and I have helped advance, develop, and transmit knowledge through my professional activities and my writing.

SSHRC also defines research and creation (it's notable, I think, that research and creativity are paired in the SSHRC definition) as "any research activity or approach to research that forms an essential part of a creative process or artistic discipline and that directly fosters the creation of literary/artistic works." By these criteria, I have a demonstrated record of outstanding, peer-reviewed, consistently endorsed literary and artistic work.

So, I suppose I should stop worrying. Besides, the Katalyst program is designed not to mirror SSHRC but to offer people like me a chance to build bridges between academic scholarship and professional pursuits that have not yet made their way into channels such as SSHRC. This is exactly what I am trying to do.
