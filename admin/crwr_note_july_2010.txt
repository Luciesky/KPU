Hi all;

In light of Mazen's email this morning regarding degree development, I thought it prudent to update the department regarding my current situation in Creative Writing. Over the past few months, we have discussed the possibility that I would work on degree development for Creative Writing in the fall; however, as of last week, this time release had not been offered to me by the Dean. In the meantime, 25 percent of my workload has been reassigned to Educational Development. This reassignment (which begins in September 2010 and is provisionally for one year) means that my workload within Creative Writing will be 25 percent for the coming year (or, one course in the fall semester and one course in the spring semester).

I learned on Friday that Mythological Narratives will be canceled for the upcoming semester. I will notify the students who are currently enrolled that the course will be offered again (for the last time, as is our plan within the department) in the Spring 2011 semester. I have made other arrangements to fill this vacancy in my workload.

With the combined developments of my partial reassignment and the cancellation of Mythological Narratives, the end result is that I will not be working in Creative Writing for Fall 2010. I will contribute when and where I can, of course, but my involvement will be reduced.

My workload is now full for the fall semester, and I will be away until September 5. With the time pressure indicated by Mazen, it is clear that the degree development project will need to be taken on by someone who is available to begin work immediately and to carry on this work into the fall.

I wanted to give the department as much notice as possible that someone else will need to take on the degree development project.
