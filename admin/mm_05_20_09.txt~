 Mission and Mandate Task Force: Institutional Context

Kwantlen is a public university with responsibility for providing accessible post-secondary education to the people of the Fraser region and British Columbia. Although we serve several regional communities, we are committed to enhancing our reputation across Canada and internationally. We actively recruit Canadian as well as international learners and prepare them to live and work in an increasingly global context. 

Kwantlen has evolved continually over its twenty-eight year history;first as a campus of Douglas College, then as Kwantlen College and Kwantlen University College. We will honor the values and traditions of our past as we fulfill our  aspirations to be a distinctive, creative, and innovative new university.

Kwantlen’s status as a Polytechnic University broadens our opportunities as we reposition ourselves in relation to other post-secondary institutions in British Columbia and across Canada. A mandate which articulates our specific intentions is fundamental to this positioning. Kwantlen’s mandate will provide a context for future planning (academic and otherwise) and will assist us in allocating our resources. 
We recognize that planning is an iterative process. The two major governing bodies of the University—the Senate and the Board of Governors—provide ongoing leadership for this process, in which principles of academic freedom, transparency and collegiality are foundational.

As a polytechnic university, Kwantlen responds to community and marketplace needs by preparing learners to be competitive in a rapidly changing world. We empower our learners to pursue professional and career opportunities as well as graduate and professional education. We recognize that career readiness requires more than skills or professional preparation. Kwantlen provides broad learning experiences that facilitate critical awareness, cultural sensitivity, social responsibility, civic engagement, and global citizenship. We expose learners to workplace experience through co-op programs, apprenticeships, service learning, internships, mentorship programs, and other forms of practica. Through continuing education, we provide educational opportunities for those seeking career change or development. 
We serve our communities by recognizing the global context of challenge and opportunity within the south Fraser region. We play a leadership role in supporting community-based initiatives to address economic, social, and cultural issues. We are committed to knowledge generation with application to and significance for regional initiatives and problems. We are committed to being learner-friendly. Our campuses welcome and provide a wide-range of facilities and resources for the community. 
From adult education courses to graduate level degrees, we offer educational opportunities accessible to a broad range of learners. We value all learning and offer flexible services and delivery methods for learners to choose educational pathways that best suit their needs. Transitions programs, multiple entry points, and bridging opportunities demonstrate our commitment to accessible lifelong learning. 
We nurture personal commitment, leadership skills and civic responsibility in all of our learners. All members of our community support an environment that maximizes learner success, encourages lifelong learning, and fosters a continuing relationship with Kwantlen. 
We recognize our pivotal role in supporting learners to develop their values, direction, and character through the integration of personal, academic, and professional development. Our approaches to teaching are based on foundational principles of mentorship, humility, discovery, purposefulness, and learner autonomy. Faculty demonstrate an authentic spirit of inquiry and model this for learners. In turn, learners are supported in diverse modes of inquiry by a teaching environment that is collaborative, innovative, creative and respectful. We embrace emerging and experimental teaching methods and research-driven pedagogy. We provide a dynamic community of inquiry that is learner-focused, innovative, interdisciplinary, and socially and culturally responsible. Learner engagement extends beyond the classroom to encompass community and industry partners and peers. 
We honour conservation and sustainability as core values. We respect, and are in harmony with, the natural environment. We pioneer the development of facilities that set new standards for operational efficiency. A variety of our programs address ecological and environmental themes directly. Our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our ongoing operations and curriculum development.
We value a diverse range of knowledge generation and we encourage applied research initiatives to address community needs. We are committed to academic freedom. We promote research, scholarship, and innovation to integrate discovery, creativity, application, and teaching. We honour and reward scholarly initiatives involving learners and the broader community in research design, development, and dissemination. 
Kwantlen is an innovative Polytechnic University that provides a balance of pure, practical and applied educational experiences to learners from diverse backgrounds. We integrate theory with practice. We serve regional needs, reflect community values, and provide a desirable destination for those seeking an accessible and relevant learning environment.
Kwantlen is both diverse and inclusive. Our continually evolving cultures, traditions, and campus environments support an organizational identity built upon a strong foundation of respect for unity within diversity. Synergies between various groups are developed, encouraged, and sustained through complementary cultures and practices that encourage autonomy, adaptability, solidarity, service, and excellence. Members of the Kwantlen community share collegial values and are committed to an institutional vision broad enough to include, respect, and value everyone. 

Kwantlen is a leader in polytechnic education. We integrate career preparation with learning in the arts and sciences to equip graduates for employment and post-graduate studies. We offer career-focused citation, certificate, diploma and baccalaureate programs in trades and technology, business, design, science, humanities, social sciences, horticulture, health sciences, journalism, and communication. Over the next five years our program offerings will be increasingly consistent with our polytechnic mandate. 
Kwantlen maintains the highest academic standards while also ensuring broad accessibility. We believe that any learner willing to work hard should have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education. To this 
end, we provide academic upgrading and support programs that prepare learners for employment and study at the university level and which ensure continuing success.
