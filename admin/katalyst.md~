## Katalyst Grant Application
### Ross A. Laird, PhD


1) Summary of proposed research

Over the past year I have worked with more than a thousand teachers, professors, educational administrators, and policy makers. I've consulted with primary and secondary schools, teacher training programs, colleges and universities, Parent Advisory Councils, health authorities, and government ministries. I've presented at conferences. I've facilitated workshops for parents, teachers, kids, counsellors, and government curriculum developers. All of this activity has focused on a single, pressing, and vexing theme: what to do about the recent changes in society -- particularly with regard to technology, and technology in education -- and how to reinvent education (perhaps using technology) to be more purposeful, relevant, and meaningful?

This is how I've worked over the past 25 years: I pursue my interest in a given area, compete for and win consulting contracts or grants to work in that area, conduct my heuristic research, and write books and articles. My scholarship has been nomadic, personal, and highly individualistic. But recently I've become interested in establishing a base for my scholarship, a means of integrating various professional threads into a more streamlined approach to enable me to write the next several books on my list of literary projects (I have written three books to date, one of which was a finalist for the Governor General's Award).

This is why, three years ago, I came to Kwantlen. I enjoy teaching as well, of course (and, if the student testimonials at kwantlen.ca/idea are any indication, I do a decent job); but research and scholarship -- and the writing that derives from those activities -- were my primary motivations. But curiously, I have found it very difficult to actually get some traction on these fronts. There seems to be no straightforward way to integrate my professional consulting and research pursuits with the Kwantlen system. My activities at Kwantlen remain completely separate from the work that I do -- and the considerable success of that work -- out in the world. Aside from the fact that this situation has me working two jobs, I find that the demands of this dilemma occupy so much of my time and attention that I have less -- not more -- time for research and writing than I did before I came to Kwantlen. So, in fact, I am moving backwards.

Here's how I'd like to remedy this. The Katalyst program is designed for precisely the kind of situation that I find myself in. I'm investigating a new area of research in which I don't yet have a history of formal publication (such as a book). I am working in an interdisciplinary way, among a wide diversity of professionals both internal and external to Kwantlen (I've worked with every Faculty at Kwantlen on themes related to technology and education). 

I'm seeking to establish a research record that will enable me to be competitive in applying for future external funding with agencies such as The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, The Canada Council, Heritage Canada, and other national organizations.

### Thus, proposals should detail how the Katalyst funded project will form the basis for future applications to provincial, national, and international funding agencies.




### Participation by undergraduate students in the proposed research is strongly encouraged, but their research responsibilities should be clearly explained.

(More than one page. Sorry.)



Provide a one-page summary of your research proposal. The proposal should be written in clear,
plain language that can be understood by all members of the Kwantlen committee. The summary
should clearly indicate the problem or issue to be addressed, the methods you will use to address it,
and the outcome, deliverables and/or product that should be available by the end of the funding
period.

2) Detailed description

Supplement your summary by providing specific information on your project. The detailed
description should include the following sections:

### Research objective

* Proposed research in the context of previous work:

I have met with excellent success in my previous professional and academic research in creativity and culture. My doctoral research project won the Union Institute's Sussman Award for Academic Excellence (the university's highest academic award), was adapted into a best-selling book, and was short-listed for the Governor General's Award (the highest arts award in Canada). The sequel to the creativity project was a heuristic investigation of the creativity of mythology, which in turn led to my involvement with the Canada Council as jurist for the Governor General's Award, jurist for Canada Council Literary grants, member of the National Council of the Writer's Union of Canada, and my ongoing involvement with the Writers' Union of Canada in the capacity of professional development consultant. Overall, my research projects in creativity have turned out well and have led to many positive outcomes (including my arrival at Kwantlen).

My proposed project continues my investigation of creativity but is now focused on a new context: education. The landscape of education has changed more rapidly in the past decade than in the previous hundred years. New technologies challenge established norms. Emerging practices promise new modes and methods. Cultural, economic, and social changes encourage (and perhaps even demand) a comprehensive review of what education is, and what it’s for. We are — to put it mildly — living through an age of educational destruction and renewal. Most of the folks I work with every day are teaching with purpose. They recognize the [mentorship](http://rosslaird.ca/resources/technology-addictions/mentorship-the-magic-bullet/ "Mentorship") role that they play in the lives of learners, and they are constantly seeking ways to improve the quality of engagement that they coax from their classes.

Educators inherit a set of old and discredited practices (lecture, expertise (aka [the empty suit](http://books.google.ca/books?id=GSBcQVd3MqYC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=taleb+expert+problem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gUcqe1NLIo&amp;sig=DU_cbfGGBtQH0hv-_nPrKO3_fes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c4isTI_ROIqusAPu29GEBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=taleb%20expert%20problem&amp;f=false "Taleb")), authority) that are ingrained into the culture of teaching by two hundred years of what might be called industrial education, in which content delivery is the primary role of the educator. The reason I am the teacher in my [Creativity class](http://rosslaird.com/courses/2011/01/03/idea-4100/ "Creativity class") (or my Mythology class, or my Writing class) has everything to do with the implied endorsement that I know more about these subjects than anyone else in the room. The truth of this endorsement is essentially irrelevant; what's important is the perception that my knowledge of the past counts. But it doesn't. At least not as much as it used to. My ability to teach is no longer hinged upon my knowledge of a given subject. This is especially true in the contemporary educational landscape, in which learners have immediate access &mdash; via the web &mdash; to repositories of knowledge that are far greater than anything individual educators can hope to provide. Everything I might say in the classroom, about any subject in which I am perceived to be the expert, can be found more easily and quickly on the web. And the context of that knowledge &mdash; on websites, in videos, linked to countless other snippets of information &mdash; is a more robust delivery system than me speaking at the front of the room. In a knowledge contest between me and a learner with a browser &mdash; even a learner with no knowledge of a given subject of my expertise &mdash; the learner would win every time. Every single time: quicker, more complete, easier.

This is the _full ‘problematic’ underlying the
investigation:_  in this new environment of traditional teaching irrelevance, what is my job?

My proposed investigation will explore the experience of educators, parents, and learners (_students_ is the more traditional term) as the educational environment shifts toward customized learning environments and digital facilitation. I'll examine how contemporary educators are helping learners build contexts for their knowledge, assisting learners in leveraging information into wisdom (whatever that means for a given field), navigating the sea of information, promoting synthesis and integration, watching and helping learners build their own skill, promoting communication and people skills, and so on. Essentially, I am interested in finding ways to cajole from learners a sense of what their educational journey _means_. (In the world of my professional activities, what something _means_ is a matter involving implications and understanding. But in the academic world, the notion of _meaning_ varies among disciplines. In the academic context, my project could be classified as interdisciplinary hermeneutics.)

The pressure to learn is going up. Issues such as climate change, political and economic instabilities, and transformations of technology all require that learners know how to learn. They need greater adaptability, a stronger instinct to question, more creative independence, and the ability to bootstrap ways of being in the world without help from experts and authorities. Crowdsourcing, digital collaboration, and grassroots community activism on the web are all transforming and integrating educational initiatives with social and cultural themes. My research will explore this landscape and its implications.

b. Methodology

I plan to conduct a heuristic research project into the lived experience of educators, learners, and parents as they navigate the transformative changes underway in education. The emphasis of the project will be on the tension between traditional educational approaches and new educational opportunities: what to keep and what to discard, what works and what doesn't, what is lost and what is gained, and how best to make it all work. This project is [fourth quadrant][1] research which lends itself well to heuristic approaches. [The fourth quadrant](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/taleb08/taleb08_index.html) describes an area of research in which sudden, unpredictable, and large-scale fluctuations tend to happen (but happen unpredictably). One recent example of this phenomenon is the market crash of 2008. Fourth quadrant (or _black swan_) situations typically involve a known and steady history of events (such as 200 years of industrial education), the sudden emergence of turbulent change (such as that brought to education by technology), and groups of people biased toward (or against) particular outcomes (such as educators and learners and their divided views about technology in education). The proposed research project meets the criteria for fourth quadrant research, for which traditional statistical models are not well-suited. Accordingly, my research will be heuristic (This is not precisely the same as _qualitative_ research. Heuristic research is a methodology; quantitative research is a class).

Heuristic research involves the "search for the discovery of meaning and essence in significant human experience. It requires a subjective process of reflecting, exploring, sifting, and elucidating the nature of the phenomenon under investigation" (Douglass and Moustakas, 1985, p.40). This collaborative research project will examine the inner lives and transformations of the participants (who will be co-researchers) as well as the inner life and transformations of the lead researcher (me). These experiences will be documented through various means: interviews, video narratives, creative projects, community events, digital documents, and so on. It's important to note that heuristic methods move beyond models of objective researcher and of subject and object. The heuristic perspective is one in which all participants are co-researchers, all phenomena are perceived in reciprocal relationship with the researchers (I influence what I study; what I study influences me), and all approaches seek integration and meaning. In this sense, heuristic research is the study of how all things are connected.

Part of the project will involve building and developing a digital collaboratory (such as has been done at [Hastac](http://hastac.org "Hastac") and Berkeley's [Townsend Humanities Lab](http://townsendlab.berkeley.edu/)). Co-researchers (educators, learners, parents) will contribute to the collaboratory, will post insights and challenges, and will allow website visitors to track the development of the project in real time. Involvement in the digital collaboratory will be offered as an option in my Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts (IDEA) courses at Kwantlen. In these courses learners have the opportunity to customize assignments and projects. For those wishing to participate in the research, assignments would involve contributions to the digital collaboratory (self-reflections, videos, narratives, etc.). This integrative, co-researcher approach embodies the values of crowdsourcing and individual autonomy that define the new cultures of technology and the emerging ethos of education.

The research content for the digital collaboratory will be open content, and release forms will be used as required. The research content intended for publication in the book (of research results) will, for the most part, be adapted for anonymity (again, release forms will be used as required). This is the approach that I have used in my previous heuristic research and which I have used extensively in my new book on addictions, based on my work as a clinical supervisor in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. This book includes material -- gathered from hundreds of people -- about their experiences of addiction. All personally-identifying content has been removed from this material.

My role will be to facilitate the creation of these research artifacts in the context of my ongoing work with educators, learners, and parents. I am already doing this now, as a professional consultant to schools, parent groups, social service agencies, and so on. I facilitate an event, I write about it, I encourage and hear from participants, I have conversations, things move along. So, in this sense, the research is already underway. As I mentioned at the outset, I'd just like a way to bring my activities more formally to Kwantlen.

c. Anticipated outcome

_Katalyst funding is primarily for new scholars wishing to make a significant start on their research career, and for experienced scholars changing research
direction into new fields._

I am an experienced scholar, but my scholarship has taken place mostly outside of academia. So, depending on how you interpret the criteria above, my project should fit somewhere. (This is a typical problem with integrative and interdisciplinary scholars and scholarship: the vexing question of where it _fits_.)

For the past several years I have been providing consulting services to schools, universities, and other educational institutions on topics related to educational renewal. This work involves the interwoven themes of pedagogy, creativity, technology, culture, change management, and childhood development. I entered this area of work as a consultant building upon my 25 years of experience in social services (as a counsellor and clinical supervisor) and education (as a facilitator and professional development consultant). Until recently, I pursued this work outside the sphere of my academic interests; but in the last two years, as I have facilitated an increasing number of workshops for teachers and professors in an educational landscape increasingly fraught by questions of what to do about changes in technology and culture, I find myself in the timely position of knowing quite a bit already about a topic of great academic and public interest.

This project will help me to integrate my professional activities with my academic interests and will promote educational renewal at Kwantlen and in the community. My project is entirely focused on Knowledge Mobilization (connectivity, the spread of knowledge, community diffusion, implementation of innovation, social change).

4) Explanation of interdisciplinary and/or collaborative nature of project

Where applicable, applicants must clearly indicate the extent to which their proposed project is
collaborative, in both intellectual content and research roles, and to identify the roles and
contributions of each member of the research team. For projects that are interdisciplinary,
clearly articulate the actual nature of that interdisciplinary contribution. In doing so, applicants
should clearly indicate the manner and extent of the relevant and unique contribution of each
member of the research team and the contribution that each ‘discipline’ will make to the
research orientation and research tasks of the project.

I find myself in an unusual and interesting position at Kwantlen. I am a qualified faculty member in four academic areas (Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts, Creative Writing, Educational Studies, and Communications), a faculty professional development consultant (in Learning Technologies), and an administrator (in the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research). The accumulated momentum of these various positions, and the ways in which my various roles interact, has led to a situation in which I do not have a fixed home at Kwantlen but rather float across, between, and within many different disciplines. I am a homeless wanderer at Kwantlen. 

One of the many things I have discovered in my travels across the hinterland of Kwantlen is that many people (faculty members, learners, administrators) seek a more engaged, transformative, responsive, and digital future for their academic pursuits. In my role as a consultant for Learning Technologies I have facilitated a number of workshops on new possibilities in education, the evolution of digital collaboratories, the migration of knowledge toward digital formats, and the rise of digital publishing. At each of these workshops I have witnessed the strong motivation from faculty members, learners, and administrators to reinvent what it means to teach and to learn, to leverage their knowledge into the online sphere, and to find serious, purposeful playfulness in the digital landscape.

The research project would involve faculty members, educators in the community, learners, parents, and administrators in a project to achieve their aims. Kwantlen community members would come from various disciplines. I have already received strong indications of support from representatives of Criminology, Anthropology, and Sociology (in the Faculty of Social Sciences); from Modern Languages and English (in the Faculty of Humanities); from Marketing, Human Resources, and Communications (in the School of Business); from the Faculty of Design, from the Faculty of Trades and Technology, and from several departments from within the Faculty of Academic and Career Advancement. I have also received similar indications of interest and support from Kwantlen's Library, from the Office of Research and Scholarship, from Learning Technologies, from the bookstore, from the Counselling department, from the Kwantlen Student Association, and from various other non-academic units. The entire educational community -- not just at Kwantlen, but everywhere -- is grappling with the challenges and opportunities that lie before us. This project would involve participants from all of the above areas, and would be an interdisciplinary, community-based, non-aligned, non-partisan approach to addressing challenges and maximizing opportunities.

As noted above, the roles of these various co-researchers would involve many possibilities: learners working on creative projects on themes of educational challenge and renewal; faculty members reflecting upon their experiences as educators; parents attending and reflecting upon events in the community; administrators discussing the challenges and opportunities that lie before them. The task of the lead researcher (me) will be to facilitate and integrate these various activities into a digital collaboratory and a book.

The individual activities that co-researchers choose will depend on their own interests and ideas. Again, heuristic research is not so much about the lead researcher (me) determining the exact structure and evolution of the project. I provide the context, the basic framework, the questions -- but the co-researchers enter the project with their own goals, aims, and ideas. This is an important clarification. Traditional academic research seeks to limit variables and uncertainty; but in my research, I seek to expand variables and uncertainty. The future of education is a landscape of extreme uncertainty. No fixed structure of inquiry (with firm numbers, set approaches, and fixed steps) will be sufficient to address the current challenges. What's required is a spirit of openness, collaboration, receptivity to surprises, comfort with uncertainty, and adaptability. In other (non-academic) contexts we might call this _play_. In the academic context, the approaches of physics are useful illustrations of what I'm talking about. Physicists build colliders (the framework), they mix things together under conditions of extreme turbulence and uncertainty (subatomic particles hurtling toward one another), and they see what happens. Then they interpret the results and write them up. This is similar to what I am doing. I provide a framework (a research project with invitations to participate from among a broad cohort), I mix things together (people collaborating as they hurtle toward their educational future), and I see what happens. Then I interpret the results (using heuristic methods) and I write them up.

5) Plans for communication of research results

Outline your plans for communication of results both within and outside the academic community.
Reference to the information on Knowledge Mobilization on the SSHRC website http://www.sshrc-
crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx (search ‘Knowledge Mobilization’) might assist you in deciding
how to frame this aspect of your research.

The project will culminate in open publishing (on the web), conference presentations (I am already presenting at many educational conferences), the digital collaboratory, and a literary book for a general audience -- as my other books have been. I am very interested in open access to information and the use of scholarship to promote the public good. Accordingly, the results of this research are intended to provide useful information and insight to general readers, parents, educators, and learners.

6) Budget justification

The budget justification should not be just a detailed itemization of the budget. For example, the
committee should be given an account of the duties of research assistants and these duties should
be reflected in the number of hours of their time requested. Similarly, equipment should be
justified – why do you need it, why is it not available to you as part of the research infrastructure,
how did you determine the anticipated cost, etc.

7) Research grant application history for applicants and co-applicants

I have entered traditional academia only recently, after a 25-year career as a consultant, educator, artist, and author. My career has been mostly what I call "in the wild": bidding for and earning contracts, competing with other consultants and educators, working creatively to spread ideas, collaborating with a wide range of professionals. I have achieved a strong track record in my career without ever having applied for a "research grant" in the sense that (I think) this section of the form requests. I imagine the intended criteria for this section involves applications for funding from organizations such as the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). My funding has never come from such sources. Instead, my research has been undertaken with support from organizations such as The Canada Council for the Arts, Heritage Canada, the BC Ministry of Health, Corrections Canada, and many private corporations. These types of organizations do not typically use the term _research grant_. Instead, they use words such as _competition_, _contract_, and _bid_. Essentially, this is the landscape with which I am most familiar and in which I have built my track record of success.

I assume that this section of the application is primarily intended to determine whether the researcher has a history of successful peer review (and, by implication, how much research funding the researcher has raised). As my research has taken place in an environment distinct from the pathways of SSHRC and related agencies, it may be useful for me to illustrate my success with some examples of the context of peer review and research funding in which I have been working.

### Peer Review in the Arts

I am a professional writer. I have written three books on interdisciplinary subjects (creativity, myth, culture, addictions). My first book evolved out of my doctoral research project, which was a heuristic study of creativity. The dissertation, which won the Union Institute's Sussman Award for Academic Excellence (the university's highest academic award), was adapted into a best-selling book and was short-listed for the Governor General's Award. In the environment of professional writing in Canada, a short-list for the Governor General's Award is the highest peer review accolade one can receive.

The success of my first book led to a second, which was published by Canada's premier literary publisher, McClelland and Stewart. Publication by M&S is a type of peer endorsement for Canadian writers (an endorsement from the gatekeepers of Canadian literature). Most of Canada's historical literary figures have published with M&S.

My ongoing success as a writer has led to my involvement with the Canada Council for the Arts. I was asked to be a jury member for the Literary Grants program and for the Governor General's Award. One cannot apply for such positions; they are by invitation only, from the foremost arts funding agency in the country. Essentially, my participation on the Governor General's Award jury (in 2008) was an endorsement from the government of Canada that I am competent to assess the literary merit of the best writers in Canada. This is a very strong "peer review" endorsement.

One more example: last year I responded to a call, from the Writers' Union of Canada (for which I have served on the National Council), to compete for a Heritage Canada contract to be one of two professional development consultants for professional writers in Canada. This was a national call, open to any professional writer. My successful bid is a strong endorsement of my role within the writing community and a clear indication that writers value what I offer. (This Heritage Canada project was intended to help writers navigate the evolving digital landscape of publishing. In many ways, writers are grappling with the same challenges as educators.)

From readers, writers, publishers, and from the government of Canada, I have consistently received strong endorsements. My peers -- at every level -- have acknowledged that I make an important contribution.

None of this work has involved "research grants" and pathways of publication in scholarly journals. Instead, my research has been published in the books and articles I have written based on my experiences as a researcher of creativity and personal development. My work has been published or reviewed in most major publications in Canada (The Globe and Mail, Maclean's, The Toronto Star, The Ottawa Citizen, The Hamilton Spectator, The Vancouver Sun, etc.), I have appeared on television and radio many times, and my writing and research continue to evolve (I am now working on a fourth book).

The funding for these projects has included book advances, jury fees, literary grant funding, and contract fees. The total amount over the past few years is roughly $100,000.

### Peer Review in Social Services

I have been a professional counsellor and clinical supervisor to social service agencies for many years. I have worked with hundreds of social service agencies and thousands of individuals. I have presented at more than 100 conferences, have facilitated hundreds of professional development projects, and have worked hard to establish a strong reputation for professionalism. In 2003 I earned the Communications Award of the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors for the heuristic research of my first two books. This year I will publish a third book, on addictions, that continues and deepens that research.

### Peer Review in Education

For the past several years I have provided professional consulting services to many groups in education.

### Peer Review at Kwantlen


### A Different Path

In composing this application I've struggled with how much of my professional background to include, as my path has been purposefully meandering and very different from the academic norm. I've consistently wondered how much of my career experience will "count" -- that is, how will my diverse, extensive, and unusual career experience be evaluated in this process? On the one hand, you could say that I have no track record of successful research grants; after all, I've never applied for a SSHRC grant (for example). On the other hand, I do have a strong track record, but one that's in a different arena than traditional academia. I've simply chosen an alternate route, in some ways a more challenging route, in which professional competition and research as practice are the norm. 

My anxiety about legitimacy is a bit ironic. SSHRC defines a "record of research achievement" as "any identifiable contributions made by applicants to the advancement, development and transmission of knowledge." By these criteria, I do indeed have a strong track record: I have made extensive contributions to several fields, and I have helped advance, develop, and transmit knowledge through my professional activities and my writing.

SSHRC also defines research and creation (it's notable, I think, that research and creativity are paired in the SSHRC definition) as "any research activity or approach to research that forms an essential part of a creative process or artistic discipline and that directly fosters the creation of literary/artistic works." By these criteria, I have a demonstrated record of outstanding, peer-reviewed, consistently endorsed literary and artistic work.

So, I suppose I should stop worrying. Besides, the Katalyst program is designed not to mirror SSHRC but to offer people like me a chance to build bridges between academic scholarship and professional pursuits that have not yet made their way into channels such as SSHRC. This is exactly what I am trying to do.

As indicated above, I have a strong track record in the research areas of creativity and culture. I have not published formally in the area of educational development (though I have been working professionally in this area for some years, and it was my main job at Kwantlen in 2010 and the first half of 2011). This project will enable me to expand my research profile into the educational area, with a view to further developing those research interests at the national level.
