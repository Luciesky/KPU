Hi Genni;

Thanks for your message.

The process that I am referring to was initiated by Linda Schwartz, in consultation with Sheila Hancock, some time before the beginning of my tenure as chair of the department. I do not know when exactly this happened, but I was told about it when I became chair. If you are not aware of this process (which, surely, included consultations with the search committee), then there was a significant gap in communications at that time (i.e. before I was chair).

My approach with regard to the issue before us is to be cautious in what I communicate, because the process originally involved the engagement of a third party to assess, from a neutral point of view, the application of Billeh to teach upper-level courses. This means that the department is, essentially, out of the conversation (by design of the process). We need to remain neutral until this process is completed or changed  -- and it is, actually, being changed (in our favour; at least that's what it looks like today). But it's at a delicate stage, and we cannot talk about this at departmental meetings. We cannot share everything about the current status of the process with everyone in the department (obviously). On the other hand, I need to communicate to the search committee (of which you are a member) that we should refrain from saying anything that might compromise the process. My email to you the other day was a kind of diplomatic caution: last week I was approached, twice, in increasingly roundabout ways, by a non-neutral party seeking information about our department. I was and remain unwilling to give this information, and I am happy to talk to you or anyone else on the search committee about this (I did talk to Aislinn, via voicemail, on the the day that I sent the email, to answer a question she had about what I sent). 

I am not trying to hide information from you, or to keep anyone out of the loop. I am trying to protect the department. Last week (and still now) I suspected that the information I refused to provide would be sought in another way; for example by way of an unsuspecting search committee member who got a phone call out of the blue. The fastest way to get in touch with people, to send a cautionary but neutral note,  was via email. So I sent an email.

I also corresponded with Mazen about this. He Said:  "I appreciate your caution and the judicious way in which you have chosen to remain neutral. In fact, I would recommend that you take steps to ensure that your entire department's attitude is aligned with yours in this respect."

An attitude of neutrality is what I was going for here, until such time as the process is reconfigured. Anything we do or say that is non-neutral will cause problems for us. When I speak to you about this I will be happy to explain the details. For now, I just wanted you to know that we are, somewhat, under scrutiny and that people are trying to force their way into our departmental business. This is what started this whole mess, and I am trying very hard to hold the line against such incursions. This has not been straightforward or simple to do.

I understand your concern about communications. There is a lot going on. I try to update everyone, at every meeting, about the things I am involved with and what is happening with administration. I think I've been reasonably thorough in doing this. Please know that I am always happy to share whatever I can (which means, essentially, everything that I know). If you feel that you want more information about anything, let me know. If you want to talk on the phone or meet in person about this current situation, let me know. This is not about secrecy but about strategy.

Cheers.

Ross
