Re: Competition Number 10-80\\

To whom it may concern;\\

Please accept my application for the position of ``time reassignment for implementation support.'' My \textit{curriculum vita}, which follows this cover letter, outlines my background and qualifications for this initiative.\\

Over the past several years, I have been keenly involved in the visioning and development of Kwantlen's emerging identity as an innovative polytechnic institution. I have worked closely with many groups and teams across several disciplines. I have developed and implemented alternative and innovative pedagogy. I have been a foundational member of collegial working groups, interdisciplinary initiatives, and service projects. I am dedicated to Kwantlen -- to the open, inviting, uncertain future that we all share.\\

My curriculum vita outlines the experience, skills, and professionalism that I would bring to the degree implementation support project. In addition to the supporting documentation provided by my curriculum vita, I would like to respond to the specific points of qualification described in the posting.\\

\textit{Build a community of inquiry}.\\
For almost 25 years, communities of inquiry -- in education, in professional development, in personal health and healing -- have been the focus of my career. I have worked with thousands of individuals in more than a hundred groups. I know how to work with people and how to build and nurture a group. Please see page \pageref{sample_consulting} for a sampling of my work with communities of inquiry.\\

\textit{Develop an implementation timeline}.\\
Working with groups both large and small on specific, time-sensitive initiatives requires a unique blend of the skills of collegiality, diplomacy, coaching, leadership, and gumption. I have developed and honed these skills throughout my career in my work with diverse groups and projects.\\

\textit{Investigate alternative/innovative pedagogies, technologies, etc.}\\
My doctoral work focused on the gifts and challenges of creativity, innovation, and discovery. My extensive teaching background 
(please see page \pageref{teaching}) has always been based on principles of innovation and alternative inquiry. The courses I teach at Kwantlen are highly innovative and engaging. Moreover, students in these courses have participated in Kwantlen's first pilot project for innovation and creativity in the use of educational technology. The horizon of discovery is where I most feel at home.\\

\textit{Document experiences and understandings.}\\
Heuristic research -- in which the study of lived experience is fused with the rigor of academic discourse -- is a subject of great interest to me. The heuristic research project of my award-winning doctoral dissertation (later adapted into the best-selling book \textit{Grain of Truth: The Ancient Lessons of Craft}; please see page \pageref{grain}) is a good example of my dedication to meaningful inquiry, careful attention to process, and commitment to professional documentation. My extensive work with project groups, in many settings and with various configurations of documentation, is another example.\\

\textit{Engage other faculty...}\\
Since coming to Kwantlen several years ago, first as a sessional instructor and increasingly as a participant in the larger conversation about what Kwantlen is and where it is going, faculty engagement has been one of my primary roles -- though, to date, it has been a role without formal structure. For example, I was the editor and copy editor for Kwantlen's mission and mandate project, which required that I work collaboratively with more than 20 stakeholders across the institution and at every level, to develop a document that represents the aspirations of the entire community. In similar fashion, I have been a member of the branding committee, of two faculty councils, of various search and development processes across the institution. I have worked extensively (and on a volunteer basis) to promote collegiality, interdisciplinarity, and faculty engagement. My record of service to Kwantlen is shown on page \pageref{service}.\\

\textit{...Conversations, workshops, and presentations}.\\
Professional workshops and presentations are foundational to my work at Kwantlen and elsewhere. I possess extensive and ongoing experience in the development and presentation of useful and purposeful events for many kinds of contexts and audiences. Examples of this work are shown on page \pageref{presentations}.\\

\textit{Establish a structure for data collection}.\\
My experience working with many groups and many diverse projects has helped me to develop a broad set of skills in collecting useful information about processes and products. I know how to help groups identify the right tools and to use them effectively.\\

\textit{Establish a structure for ongoing collegial faculty engagement}.\\
In my view, collegial faculty engagement is one of the most challenging and promising areas at Kwantlen. The University is undergoing many transformative changes and is seeking ways to find secure footing on shifting ground. This is precisely the kind of ground I feel most comfortable upon. Helping others find their footing is what I do best.\\

The posting indicates that ``applicants should have considerable expertise and experience in adult education, interdisciplinary curriculum design, coaching, counselling, and change management.'' I have been working in the field of adult education for almost 25 years (see pages \pageref{teaching}, \pageref{sample_consulting}, and \pageref{sample_supervision}). Interdisciplinary philosophy was the focus of my doctoral work, interdisciplinary curriculum design has been the focus of my educational activity for many years, and interdisciplinarity is the core of my contribution at Kwantlen. I have been a successful (and award-winning; see page \pageref{awards}) consultant, supervisor, and instructor in counselling, coaching, and change management (see page \pageref{sample_consulting}).\\

The posting indicates that the successful candidate will possess ``a broad repertoire of both pedagogical and technological tools and experience with blended learning models.'' I have been working with Kwantlen IET on a technology pilot project for curriculum design and delivering workshops to faculty on engaged and blended learning with technology. I have been at the forefront of these developments at Kwantlen and will continue to advocate for greater creativity, innovation, and technological adoption.\\
\newpage
The posting indicates that the successful candidate will ``lead from a supportive stance, [have the] ability to work with a team, and [show] demonstrated success in project work.'' My success in supportive, collegial consultation is demonstrated by the sample list of groups and projects on pages \pageref{sample_consulting} and \pageref{sample_supervision}. Working well with groups is what I do. I have been doing it for many years and in many contexts.\\

And finally, the posting indicates that ``course development experience and familiarity with the program approval process at Kwantlen will be assets.'' I have been the sole developer of one degree proposal, have been a consultant and developer for three further proposals, and have developed several courses. I am familiar with the processes at Kwantlen and the many considerations required to develop a project from concept to completion.\\

I appreciate your consideration of my application, and I look forward to meeting with the search committee to further explore the ways in which I can serve the Kwantlen community.\\

Sincerely,\\
