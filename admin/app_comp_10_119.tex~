Kwantlen Polytechnic University\\
Re: Competition Number 10-119\\

To whom it may concern;\\

Please accept my application for the position of Co-Director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research: Community Learning and Engagement. My \textit{curriculum vita}, which follows this cover letter, summarizes my background and qualifications.\\

Over the past several years, I have been keenly involved in the visioning and development of Kwantlen's emerging identity as an innovative polytechnic institution. I have worked closely with many groups and teams across several disciplines. I have developed and implemented alternative and innovative pedagogy (especially as regards technology). I have been a foundational member of collegial working groups, interdisciplinary initiatives, and service projects. I am dedicated to Kwantlen -- to the open, inviting, uncertain future that we all share.\\

My curriculum vita outlines the experience, skills, and professionalism that I would bring to CIR:CLE. In addition to the supporting documentation provided by my curriculum vita, I would like to respond to the specific points of qualification described in the posting.\\

\textit{Integrate new technology and digital collaboration}.\\
My doctoral work focused on the gifts and challenges of creativity, innovation, collaboration, and discovery. Currently I am the lead developer of Kwantlen's new DECK technology, an online collaboration and research tool that is now moving from pilot stage to full implementation (\url{deck.kwantlen.ca}). I am a member of Kwantlen's Instructional and Educational Technologies department. Students in my Interdisciplinary expressive Arts courses have participated in Kwantlen's first pilot project for innovation and creativity in the use of educational technology. I am a consultant for several groups at Kwantlen and at other educational institutions seeking ways to integrate new and emerging technologies. The horizon of discovery is where I most feel at home.\\

\textit{Develop Internal and External Advisory Boards}.\\
For almost 25 years, communities of inquiry -- in education, in community development, in the arts, in the corporate sector -- have been the focus of my career. I have worked with thousands of individuals in more than a hundred organizations. I know how to work with people, how to build and nurture a group, and how to achieve common goals. Please see page \pageref{sample_consulting} for a sampling of my work with communities, groups, and boards.\\

\textit{Develop collaborative approaches for working with indigenous communities}.\\
I have worked with Aboriginal groups both large and small, on reserve and off, in urban and rural settings. This work requires a unique blend of the skills of collegiality, diplomacy, coaching, leadership, and gumption. I have developed and honed these skills throughout my career in my work with diverse groups and projects.\\

\textit{Develop community research projects}.\\
Heuristic research -- in which the study of lived experience is fused with the rigor of academic discourse -- is a subject of great interest to me. The heuristic research project of my award-winning doctoral dissertation (later adapted into the best-selling book \textit{Grain of Truth: The Ancient Lessons of Craft}; please see page \pageref{grain}) is a good example of my dedication to meaningful inquiry, community engagement, careful attention to process, and commitment to professional documentation. My extensive work with project groups, in many settings and with various configurations of research and documentation, is another example.\\

\textit{Build collegiality and consensus}.\\
Since coming to Kwantlen several years ago, first as a sessional instructor and increasingly as a participant in the larger conversation about what Kwantlen is and where it is going, faculty engagement has been one of my primary roles. For example, I was the editor and copy editor for Kwantlen's mission and mandate project, which required that I work collaboratively with more than 20 stakeholders across the institution and at every level, to develop a document that represents the aspirations of the entire community. In similar fashion, I have been a member of the branding committee, of two faculty councils, and of various search and development processes. I have worked extensively (and mostly on a volunteer basis) to promote collegiality, interdisciplinarity, and faculty engagement. Currently I have been seconded to work on technology projects and degree implementation projects, both of which involve diverse groups of colleagues trying to build consensus. In my view, collegial faculty engagement is one of the most challenging and promising areas at Kwantlen. The University is undergoing many transformative changes and is seeking ways to find secure footing on shifting ground. This is precisely the kind of ground I feel most comfortable upon. My success in supportive, collegial consultation is demonstrated by the sample list of groups and projects on pages \pageref{sample_consulting} and \pageref{sample_supervision}. Working well with groups is what I do. I have been doing it for many years and in many contexts.\\

The posting indicates that the successful candidate will possess ``a broad range of interdisciplinary academic skills.'' I possess an interdisciplinary doctorate, I am an award-winning interdisciplinary scholar, I lead the Interdisciplinary Expressive Arts program at Kwantlen, and I am the developer of the proposed Department of Interdisciplinary Studies.\\

The posting requests ``extensive and current experience working in the community, including indigenous communities.'' As noted above, I have worked for almost 25 years in the community as a consultant, teacher, leader, facilitator, and developer. Aboriginal projects represent a large part of that work. I have consulted for individual bands (the Kwantlen First Nation, for example), for linked Aboriginal communities (in Haida Gwaii, for example), and for Aboriginal social service agencies (I am the professional development consultant for Anishnawbe Health, Canada's premier Aboriginal social service agency).\\

The posting also requests that the successful candidate will possess ``the capacity to access research funds from both non-traditional and academic sources.'' I am both an academic practitioner with a proven record of securing funding from traditional academic sources (federal, provincial, and local), and a consultant for whom non-traditional funding is simply a matter of course. In the community context, I have secured hundreds of non-traditional funding contracts (for close to 20 years, this was the primary way that I made my living).\\

I appreciate your consideration of my application.\\

Sincerely,\\
