    {\LARGE First-Year Initiative}\\[2em]

In July 2012, the first phase of the 2011-12 Foundations of Excellence
(FoE)program produced reports and recommendations from each of the nine
FoE dimension committees. The resulting Executive Summary identified
specific themes within the recommendations. In February 2013, the FoE
steering committee reconvened under the revised heading of KPU First
Year Initiative (KPU -- FYI) to review this work. The committee
aggregated the recommendations according to themes (rather than
dimensions) and worked to identify correlations between and across themes.

Concurrent to the work of FYI, Kwantlen also began developing and implementing a formalized Academic Plan. This planning process resulted in many key insights (about international education, the needs of Aboriginal students, and so on) and also confirmed the critical importance of first-year experiences. The FYI results therefore complement and augment the themes of the academic planning initiative, which focus on a time horizon of five years. Accordingly we have included the following FYI recommendations within that five-year time frame.

We also make the general recommendation that the KPU academic plan incorporate, as much as possible, the FYI material. Both of these broad initiatives ask foundational questions about what KPU will look like in five years, what kinds of experiences we want for our students, and what our learning environments should provide for our community.

We expect (and hope) that the positive momentum for support of first-year students at KPU will continue to increase. In order to facilitate this momentum we advocate the following recommendations, which form the core of our results.
